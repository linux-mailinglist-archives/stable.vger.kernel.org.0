3.16.78-rc1 review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Fuqian Huang <huangfq.daxian@gmail.com>

commit 541ab2aeb28251bf7135c7961f3a6080eebcc705 upstream.

Emulation of VMPTRST can incorrectly inject a page fault
when passed an operand that points to an MMIO address.
The page fault will use uninitialized kernel stack memory
as the CR2 and error code.

The right behavior would be to abort the VM with a KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR
exit to userspace; however, it is not an easy fix, so for now just ensure
that the error code and CR2 are zero.
