Dear Friend,

I am Mr.Ahmed Shaibu, an auditor with one of the new generation banks
in Burkina Faso , west Africa.

There was an account opened in this bank in 1998 and since 2002 nobody
has operated on this account again. After going through some old files
in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out
urgently, this funds will go down the drains, into the hands of either
the board of directors of this bank or the funds may eventually be
discovered by the government as a dormant fund in the forth coming
audit by the Nation's auditors.

They will confiscate or send it into the government's treasury
account. The question now is who is the government and where is the
treasury? These are human beings like you and I. The owner of this
account is Mr Hatem Kamil Abdul Fattah an Iraqi national and a miner
at Kruger gold co, a geologist by profession and he died in 2003 . No
other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as
well that his company does not know anything about this account.

The amount involved is Ten Million, Five hundred thousand  United
States Dollars.($10.500.000) I am only contacting you, as a foreigner
because this money cannot be approved to a local bank account here,
but can only be approved to any foreign account and foreign
beneficiary because the money is in US dollars and the real owner of
the account is Mr Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah, himself a foreigner too.

I only got your contact address from my secretary who operates
computer; with belief in God that you will never let me down in this
business so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the
management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner, who has
correct information of this account, which I will give to you later,
if you will be able to handle such amount in strict confidence and
trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit
because this opportunity will never come again in our life time

With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any
foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your
country for sharing and investment.

I will also use my position and influence to effect legal approvals
for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate
clearance documents from the ministries and foreign exchange
department.But, only it will cost us small money as to procure such
back up documents from the ministries concerned.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
I look forward to your earliest reply.

Yours Friendly,

Mr. Ahmed Shaibu.
