I don't think there is any reason for backporting this patch at this
stage. It isn't a fix, and we don't plan to support the feature it
subsequently enables in anything older than 5.13.

Unless there is a another pressing reason for adding this patch, I
suggest it is dropped from 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 stable branches.

Thanks,

	M.
