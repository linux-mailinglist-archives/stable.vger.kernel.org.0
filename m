I think it would be worth spelling this out with an example. The issue
appears to be a concurrent reader in interrupt context taking and releasing
the lock in the window where the writer has returned from the
atomic_cond_read_acquire() but has not yet performed the cmpxchg(). Loads
can be speculated during this time, but the A-B-A of the lock word
from _QW_WAITING to (_QW_WAITING | _QR_BIAS) and back to _QW_WAITING allows
the atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed() to succeed. Is that right?

With that in mind, it would probably be a good idea to eyeball the qspinlock
slowpath as well, as that uses both atomic_cond_read_acquire() and
atomic_try_cmpxchg_relaxed().

Typo in the quoted subject ('qrwloc').

Patch looks good, so with an updated message:
