commit 3d584a3c85d6fe2cf878f220d4ad7145e7f89218 upstream.

When fall-through warnings was enabled by default, commit d93512ef0f0e
("Makefile: Globally enable fall-through warning"), the following
warnings was starting to show up:

Rework to add a 'break;' in the swich-case since it didn't have that,
leading to an interresting set of bugs.
