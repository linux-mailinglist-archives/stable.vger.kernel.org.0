Hello,

We ran automated tests on a recent commit from this kernel tree:

       Kernel repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/st=
able-queue.git
            Commit: 4d4be24ef9f9 - ARM: 8904/1: skip nomap memblocks while =
finding the lowmem/highmem boundary

The results of these automated tests are provided below.

    Overall result: PASSED
             Merge: OK
           Compile: OK
             Tests: OK

All kernel binaries, config files, and logs are available for download here=
:

Please reply to this email if you have any questions about the tests that w=
e
ran or if you have any suggestions on how to make future tests more effecti=
ve.

Compile testing
---------------

We compiled the kernel for 3 architectures:

    aarch64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg

    ppc64le:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg

    x86_64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg


Hardware testing
----------------
We booted each kernel and ran the following tests:

    =E2=9A=A1 Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests (m=
arked
    with =E2=9A=A1=E2=9A=A1=E2=9A=A1) from running on this architecture.
    This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

  Test sources: https://github.com/CKI-project/tests-beaker
    =F0=9F=92=9A Pull requests are welcome for new tests or improvements to=
 existing tests!

Waived tests
------------
If the test run included waived tests, they are marked with =F0=9F=9A=A7. S=
uch tests are
executed but their results are not taken into account. Tests are waived whe=
n
their results are not reliable enough, e.g. when they're just introduced or=
 are
being fixed.

Testing timeout
---------------
We aim to provide a report within reasonable timeframe. Tests that haven't
finished running are marked with =E2=8F=B1. Reports for non-upstream kernel=
s have
a Beaker recipe linked to next to each host.
