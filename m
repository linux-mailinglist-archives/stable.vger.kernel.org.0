Greeting

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments and I sorry
to approach you through this media it is because it serves the fastest
means of communication. I came across your E-mail from my personal
search and I decided to contact you believing you will be honest to
fulfill my final wish before I die.

I am Mrs. Elizabeth Edward, 63 years, from USA, I am childless and I
am suffering from a pro-long critical cancer, my doctors confirmed I
may not live beyond two months from now as my ill health has defiled
all forms of medical treatment.

Since my days are numbered, I=E2=80=99ve decided willingly to fulfill my
long-time promise to donate you the sum ($5.000.000.00) million
dollars I inherited from my late husband Mr. Edward Herbart, foreign
bank account over years. I need a very honest person who can assist in
transfer of this money to his or her account and use the funds for
charities work of God while you use 50% for yourself. I want you to
know there are no risk involved, it is 100% hitch free & safe. If you
will be interesting to assist in getting this fund into your account
for charity project to fulfill my promise before I die please let me
know immediately. I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality as I
wait for your reply.

Best Regards

Mrs. Elizabeth Edward
