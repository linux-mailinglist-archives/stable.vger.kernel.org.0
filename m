Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Limit MST to <= 8bpc once again
Date:   Wed, 28 Aug 2019 13:20:59 +0300

From: Ville Syrj채l채 <ville.syrjala@linux.intel.com>

My attempt at allowing MST to use the higher color depths has
regressed some configurations. Apparently people have setups
where all MST streams will fit into the DP link with 8bpc but
won't fit with higher color depths.

What we really should be doing is reducing the bpc for all the
streams on the same link until they start to fit. But that requires
a bit more work, so in the meantime let's revert back closer to
the old behavior and limit MST to at most 8bpc.
