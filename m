DEAREST ONE IN LORD,


 I AM  MRS.  VERONICA WILLIAMS FROM FRANCE.

  I WAS MARRIED TO MR. DAVIDA WILLIAMS PIERCES, WHO WORKED WITH FRANCE
COCOA COMPANY  IN BURKINA FASO AND IVORY COAST FOR NINE YEARS BEFORE
HE DIED IN 2015. WE WERE MARRIED FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS WITHOUT A CHILD.

 HE DIED AFTER A BRIEF HEART ILLNESS THAT LASTED FOR FEW DAYS, DOCTORS
 SAID DUE TO SMOKING.  WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALIVE HE DEPOSITED THE SUM
OF ($ 11.3 MILLION) IN
 THE BANK   HERE ON FIXED DEPOSIT GROW ACCOUNT ASSETS.

 CURRENTLY, THE FUND IS STILL IN THE BANK. RECENTLY I BECAME
DIAGNOSING OF THROAT CANCER, HOSPITALIZE FOR OVER BAD 8 MONTHS NOW, MY
DOCTORS HAS SAID THAT I HAVE SERIOUS SICKNESS WITH KIDNEY PROBLEMS
TOO. WHAT  DISTURBS ME MOST IS MY STROKE ON LEGS.  AND SO KNOWING
ABOUT MY CONDITION I DECIDED TO DONATE SAVINGS TO CHURCH AND TO THOSE
WHO CAN UTILIZE THIS MONEY FOR HELPING THE NEEDY AND MOSTLY
ORPHANAGES.

 I WANT A PERSON THAT WILL USE THIS FUND FOR ORPHANAGES, WIDOWS, TO
PROMOTE THE WORD OF GOD

REPLY ME FOR MORE INFORMATION'S, FOR ME TO SEND WILL OF ORDERS TO MY
BANK FOR TRANSFERRING THE FUNDS I SAID TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT FOR
CHARITY ORPHANAGE AND TO HELP YOURSELF IN USE PART OF THE FUNDS.

 I WAIT YOUR REPLY

 YOURS FAITHFUL IN CHRIST

MS.VERO
