Dear Friend.




I am Mr Yatmir Nutha. the director of the accounts & auditing
department at the bank Ouagadougou-Burkina Faso in west Africa. With
due respect, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction
that will be beneficial to both of us.

At the bank's last accounts/auditing evaluations, my staffs came
across an old account which was being maintained by a foreign client
who we learn was among the deceased passengers of motor accident on
November.2003, the deceased was unable to run this account since his
death. The account has remained dormant without the knowledge of his
family since it was put in a safe deposit account in the bank for
future investment by the client.

Since his demise, even the members of his family haven't applied for
claims over this fund and it has been in the safe deposit account
until I discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client is a
foreign national and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to
file claims over the money. As the director of the department,this
discovery was brought to my office so as to decide what is to be
done.I decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out
of the bank and out of the country too.

The total amount in the account is ten million five hundred thousand
dollars (USD 10,500,000.00).with my positions as staffs of the bank, I
am handicapped because I cannot operate foreign accounts and cannot
lay bonafide claim over this money. The client was a foreign national
and you will only be asked to act as his next of kin and I will supply
you with all the necessary information and bank data to assist you in
being able to transfer this money to any bank of your choice where
this money could be transferred into.

The total sum will be shared as follows: 50% for me, 50% for you and
expenses incidental occur during the transfer will be incur by both of
us. The transfer is risk free on both sides hence you are going to
follow my instruction till the fund transfer to your account.Since I
work in this bank that is why you should be confident in the success
of this transaction because you will be updated with information as at
when desired.

I will wish you to keep this transaction secret and confidential as I
am hoping to retire with my share of this money at the end of
transaction which will be when this  money is safety in your account.
I will then come over to your country for sharing according to the
previously agreed percentages. You might even have to advise me on
possibilities of investment in your country or elsewhere of our
choice. May God help you to help me to a restive retirement, Amen.

Please for further information and inquires feel free to contact me
back immediately for more explanation and better understanding I want
you to assure me your capability of handling this project with trust.

Contact me via Email: yatmirnutha@gmail.com
Thanks and remain blessed
Mr Yatmir Nutha.
