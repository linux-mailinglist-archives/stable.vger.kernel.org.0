Debian oldstable is using 4.19 kernel.

OpenWRT is using 4.14 kernel and only recently there was a new release
where is 5.4 kernel.

So these old kernels are still widely used.

But I do not think that spending time on backporting whole emulated
bridge to these kernels is something very important...
