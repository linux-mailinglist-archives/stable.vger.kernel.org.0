Early in my work on j2, I tried to research the history of shared flat
support on sh, and it turned out the mainline tooling never even
supported it, and the out-of-line tooling I eventually found was using
all sorts of wrong conditionals for how it did the linking and elf2flt
conversion, e.g. mere presence of any PIC-like relocation in any file
made it assume the whole program was PIC-compatible. There's no way
that stuf was ever used in any meaningful way. It just didn't work.

Quickly dropped that and got plain ELF (no shared text/xip, but no
worse than the existing flat support) working, and soon after, FDPIC.

The whole binfmt_flat ecosystem is a mess with no good reason to
exist.
