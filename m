commit d201238ccd2f30b9bfcfadaeae0972e3a486a176 upstream.

[BUG]
There is a report that a btrfs has a bad super block num devices.

This makes btrfs to reject the fs completely.

  BTRFS error (device sdd3): super_num_devices 3 mismatch with num_devices 2 found here
  BTRFS error (device sdd3): failed to read chunk tree: -22
  BTRFS error (device sdd3): open_ctree failed

[CAUSE]
During btrfs device removal, chunk tree and super block num devs are
updated in two different transactions:

  btrfs_rm_device()
  |- btrfs_rm_dev_item(device)
  |  |- trans = btrfs_start_transaction()
  |  |  Now we got transaction X
  |  |
  |  |- btrfs_del_item()
  |  |  Now device item is removed from chunk tree
  |  |
  |  |- btrfs_commit_transaction()
  |     Transaction X got committed, super num devs untouched,
  |     but device item removed from chunk tree.
  |     (AKA, super num devs is already incorrect)
  |
  |- cur_devices->num_devices--;
  |- cur_devices->total_devices--;
  |- btrfs_set_super_num_devices()
     All those operations are not in transaction X, thus it will
     only be written back to disk in next transaction.

So after the transaction X in btrfs_rm_dev_item() committed, but before
transaction X+1 (which can be minutes away), a power loss happen, then
we got the super num mismatch.

This has been fixed by commit bbac58698a55 ("btrfs: remove device item
and update super block in the same transaction").

[FIX]
Make the super_num_devices check less strict, converting it from a hard
error to a warning, and reset the value to a correct one for the current
or next transaction commit.

As the number of device items is the critical information where the
super block num_devices is only a cached value (and also useful for
cross checking), it's safe to automatically update it. Other device
related problems like missing device are handled after that and may
require other means to resolve, like degraded mount. With this fix,
potentially affected filesystems won't fail mount and require the manual
repair by btrfs check.
