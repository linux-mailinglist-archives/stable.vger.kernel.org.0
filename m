Yes, good point.

Except power_supply structure there is the device state struct
bq27xxx_device_info 'di'. If bq27xxx_battery_poll() is called during the
unbind, it will access the 'di' which is being freed by devm-framework.
And just checking for di->bat is also not thread safe (can be
reordered).

I think there is no easy few-line fix for this.  Instead, the
workqueue scheduling should be guarded everywhere by device-instance
mutex (bq27xxx_device_info.lock).

Exactly.
