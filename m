Seems about right, so on those averages, you have missed about 40-50
patches that should have been cc:ed stable.

However, you are comparing yourself against stuff like drivers/net/
which shouldn't have cc: stable for most stuff (as per the networking
workflow), and other subsystems that seem to never want to cc: stable
for various reasons (offenders not mentioned to be nice...)

So let's bump that number up a bit, maybe you are missing 100 patches
this past year that should have been backported?

Feels like you all could tag more, even if the number is only 40-50 :)

Oh wait, are you sure you don't count the horrid "double commits" where
you backport something from your development branch to your "for linus"
branch, and have cc: stable on both, so that during the -rc1 merge
window I see a ton of commits that are already in the tree?  That would
inflate your numbers a lot more so your real percentages might be a lot
lower...

fun with math.
