[ Upstream commit a4ae32c71fe90794127b32d26d7ad795813b502e ]

An invariant of cap_bprm_set_creds is that every field in the new cred
structure that cap_bprm_set_creds might set, needs to be set every
time to ensure the fields does not get a stale value.

The field cap_ambient is not set every time cap_bprm_set_creds is
called, which means that if there is a suid or sgid script with an
interpreter that has neither the suid nor the sgid bits set the
interpreter should be able to accept ambient credentials.
Unfortuantely because cap_ambient is not reset to it's original value
the interpreter can not accept ambient credentials.

Given that the ambient capability set is expected to be controlled by
the caller, I don't think this is particularly serious.  But it is
definitely worth fixing so the code works correctly.

I have tested to verify my reading of the code is correct and the
interpreter of a sgid can receive ambient capabilities with this
change and cannot receive ambient capabilities without this change.
