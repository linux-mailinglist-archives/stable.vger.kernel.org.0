[ Upstream commit 4df2a8b0ad634d98a67e540a4e18a60f943e7d9f ]

Place a comment in hidma_mgmt_init explaining why success must
currently be assumed, due to the cleanup issue that would need to
be considered were this module ever to be unloadable or were this
platform_driver_register call ever to fail.

+	 * cleaned up if it does fail, and to do this work is quite
+	 * complicated. In particular, various calls of of_address_to_resource,
+	 * of_irq_to_resource, platform_device_register_full, of_dma_configure,
+	 * and of_msi_configure which then call other functions and so on, must
+	 * be cleaned up - this is not a trivial exercise.
+	 *
+	 * Currently, this module is not intended to be unloaded, and there is
+	 * no module_exit function defined which does the needed cleanup. For
+	 * this reason, we have to assume success here.
