[ Upstream commit 38b7c2a3ffb1fce8358ddc6006cfe5c038ff9963 ]

While digging through the recent mmiowb preemption issue it came up that
we aren't actually preventing IO from crossing a scheduling boundary.
While it's a bit ugly to overload smp_mb__after_spinlock() with this
behavior, it's what PowerPC is doing so there's some precedent.
