commit fe0a916c1eae8e17e86c3753d13919177d63ed7e upstream.

Checking for the lack of epitems refering to the epoll we want to insert into
is not enough; we might have an insertion of that epoll into another one that
has already collected the set of files to recheck for excessive reverse paths,
but hasn't gotten to creating/inserting the epitem for it.

However, any such insertion in progress can be detected - it will update the
generation count in our epoll when it's done looking through it for files
to check.  That gets done under ->mtx of our epoll and that allows us to
detect that safely.

We are *not* holding epmutex here, so the generation count is not stable.
However, since both the update of ep->gen by loop check and (later)
insertion into ->f_ep_link are done with ep->mtx held, we are fine -
the sequence is
	grab epmutex
	bump loop_check_gen
	...
	grab tep->mtx		// 1
	tep->gen = loop_check_gen
	...
	drop tep->mtx		// 2
	...
	grab tep->mtx		// 3
	...
	insert into ->f_ep_link
	...
	drop tep->mtx		// 4
	bump loop_check_gen
	drop epmutex
and if the fastpath check in another thread happens for that
eventpoll, it can come
	* before (1) - in that case fastpath is just fine
	* after (4) - we'll see non-empty ->f_ep_link, slow path
taken
	* between (2) and (3) - loop_check_gen is stable,
with ->mtx providing barriers and we end up taking slow path.

Note that ->f_ep_link emptiness check is slightly racy - we are protected
against insertions into that list, but removals can happen right under us.
Not a problem - in the worst case we'll end up taking a slow path for
no good reason.
