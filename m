My Dear in the lord


My name is Mrs. Mina A. Brunel I am a Norway Citizen who is living in Burki=
na Faso, I am married to Mr. Brunel Patrice, a politicians who owns a small=
 gold company in Burkina Faso; He died of Leprosy and Radesyge, in year Feb=
ruary 2010, During his lifetime he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 8.5 Milli=
on Euro) Eight million, Five hundred thousand Euros in a bank in Ouagadougo=
u the capital city of of Burkina in West Africa. The money was from the sal=
e of his company and death benefits payment and entitlements of my deceased=
 husband by his company.

I am sending you this message with heavy tears in my eyes and great sorrow =
in my heart, and also praying that it will reach you in good health because=
 I am not in good health, I sleep every night without knowing if I may be a=
live to see the next day. I am suffering from long time cancer and presentl=
y I am partially suffering from Leprosy, which has become difficult for me =
to move around. I was married to my late husband for more than 6 years with=
out having a child and my doctor confided that I have less chance to live, =
having to know when the cup of death will come, I decided to contact you to=
 claim the fund since I don't have any relation I grew up from an orphanage=
 home.

I have decided to donate this money for the support of helping Motherless b=
abies/Less privileged/Widows and churches also to build the house of God be=
cause I am dying and diagnosed with cancer for about 3 years ago. I have de=
cided to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for =
the good work of Almighty God; I will be going in for an operation surgery =
soon.

Now I want you to stand as my next of kin to claim the funds for charity pu=
rposes. Because of this money remains unclaimed after my death, the bank ex=
ecutives or the government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe =
use it for selfishness and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person =
who can claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, wido=
ws and also build schools and churches for less privilege that will be name=
d after my late husband and my name.

I need your urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this proje=
ct, and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferre=
d to your bank account or online banking.

Thanks
Mrs. Mina A. Brunel
