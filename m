Sir,
I run a private consulting firm, advisory and other services to clients here in Cardiff (UK) and I got your contact through the internet in my quest by one my clients from Caracas - Venezuela asking for an eligible agencies or investor assistance in re profiling this fund US$180 Million out of Caracas - Venezuela for JVC Investment Partners ("JVC") due to triggering crises in financial capitals, great recession, business is considered risky, investors/ relevant stakeholders are withdrawing or curtailing their investment, Venezuela is characterized by marked change in the social and political order. Security situation is rapidly deteriorating, state of emergency, government have lost all legitimacy to rule, political unrest, lack of due anticipated legal process.

As part of our investment expansion plan, we are ready to facilitate and fund projects internationally that are capable of generating at least 10% Annual Return on Investment (AROI). We are also able to provide funding via direct investment depending on the nature of the business plan. If both parties agree on all terms and conditions, we shall execute a joint venture contract (“JVC”) and finally we shall transfer US$180 Million to your bank account within ten (10) business days from the date of confirmation notice of your project management capabilities to execute this project. If you are interested in partnering with our group, kindly send to me your executive summary or business plan directly by Email: tbfisher@meta.ua / tfisher1865@meta.ua / tfisher7533032@meta.ua
