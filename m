With said commit reverted and 5.15.38 I got 1 successful resume and 1 lockup.
Difference is that with the patch reverted, the locked-up system can be pinged
(unlike with the patch applied), though resume still does not finish properly and
now probably runs into the problem that the patch was trying to fix.
Any network services like ssh are still dead though.
This used to work every time, all the time..looks like I'll try removing the
module before suspend.
