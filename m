This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    xhci: Fix USB 3.1 capability detection on early xHCI 1.1 spec based

to my usb git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git
in the usb-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: xhci: Fix USB 3.1 capability detection on early xHCI 1.1 spec based
 hosts
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Early xHCI 1.1 spec did not mention USB 3.1 capable hosts should set
sbrn to 0x31, or that the minor revision is a two digit BCD
containing minor and sub-minor numbers.
This was later clarified in xHCI 1.2.

Some USB 3.1 capable hosts therefore have sbrn set to 0x30, or minor
revision set to 0x1 instead of 0x10.

Detect the USB 3.1 capability correctly for these hosts as well
