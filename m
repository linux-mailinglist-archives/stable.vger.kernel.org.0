Not "the" regression, and not even _a_ *regression*. 2/3 fixes an pre-existing and unrelated problem. Or only tangentially related if you want. 2/3 fixes a hang if two engine resets would happen to coincide. Nothing about TLB flushing.

Well if we want to be pedantic what do stable rules say about adding new features - is skipping idle engines (which is a software concept) a fix or a new optimisation?

Agreed. But the point of my argument is that a) 1st patch does not fix anything on it's own (in relation to the regression), b) is adding improvements which will just be extra work to backport to old kernels.

What about intel_engine_pm_is_awake, what will you do with that one?
