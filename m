The LOAD_UEFI_KEYS code isn't doing anything special here - it's just 
trying to read some variables. If we simply disable that then the 
expectation would be that reading the same variables from userland would 
trigger the same failure. So the question is which of the variables that 
LOAD_UEFI_KEYS accesses is triggering the failure, and what's special 
about that? If it's a specific variable GUID or name that's failing, we 
should block that on Apple hardware in order to avoid issues caused by 
userland performing equivalent accesses.
