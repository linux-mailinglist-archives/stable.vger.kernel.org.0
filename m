Greetings,

My name is Mr.Comrade Vahid Armstrone, Chief Operating Financial
Officer in dubai islamic bank, here in united arab emirates, It is
true that we have not meet each other in person, but I strongly
believe in trust and friendship in every business. As I am contacting
you independently of my investigation and no one is informed of this
communication.

My reason for contacting you is to transfer an abandoned sum of
$10.5million Dollars  immediately to your private account, the money
has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody
coming for the claim of it.

The funds belong to our deceased Customer Mrs.Shannel Lake who
perished along with her family since 9 years ago The Banking laws here
does not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, that is the
reason why I need your Cooperation in transferring the money to your
bank account so that we can use it to secure the future of our both
families because I don't want the money to be recalled to the bank
treasury as unclaimed fund.

For the success of this operation, you should keep strictly
confidential what I have just confided in you. Only this condition can
allow us to achieve total success.

Mr. Comrade Vahid Armstrone.
Chief Operating Financial Officer,
DUBAI ISLAMIC BANK.
