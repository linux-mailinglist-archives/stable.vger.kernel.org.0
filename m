Hello,

We ran automated tests on a recent commit from this kernel tree:

       Kernel repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linu=
x-stable-rc.git
            Commit: dfae536f94c2 - Linux 5.4.20-rc1

The results of these automated tests are provided below.

    Overall result: FAILED (see details below)
             Merge: OK
           Compile: OK
             Tests: FAILED

All kernel binaries, config files, and logs are available for download here:

  https://cki-artifacts.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=3Ddatawa=

One or more kernel tests failed:

    x86_64:
     =E2=9D=8C Networking route_func - local

We hope that these logs can help you find the problem quickly. For the full
detail on our testing procedures, please scroll to the bottom of this message.

Please reply to this email if you have any questions about the tests that we
ran or if you have any suggestions on how to make future tests more effective.

Compile testing
---------------

We compiled the kernel for 3 architectures:

    aarch64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg

    ppc64le:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg

    x86_64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg


Hardware testing
----------------
We booted each kernel and ran the following tests:

  aarch64:

marked
       with =E2=9A=A1=E2=9A=A1=E2=9A=A1) from running on this architecture.
       This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

    =F0=9F=92=9A Pull requests are welcome for new tests or improvements to e=
xisting tests!

Waived tests
------------
If the test run included waived tests, they are marked with =F0=9F=9A=A7. Suc=
h tests are
executed but their results are not taken into account. Tests are waived when
their results are not reliable enough, e.g. when they're just introduced or a=
re
being fixed.

Testing timeout
---------------
We aim to provide a report within reasonable timeframe. Tests that haven't
finished running are marked with =E2=8F=B1. Reports for non-upstream kernels =
have
a Beaker recipe linked to next to each host.
