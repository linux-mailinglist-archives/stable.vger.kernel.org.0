Thanks Ville for providing your input here, the display glitches is fixed by 
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/405585/?series=84394&rev=2 patch in case
of brightness being updated simultaneously with flips, so it was our wild guess
that if intel_pipe_update_start  triggers before completing DC3CO exit delay in
tgl_disable_dc3co could cause the display glitches but that was not true.

Certainly this should fix the issue. I will try this out but i feel this 
could cause heavy lock contention around power_domains->lock in case 
brightness being updated rapidly as the scenario of this issue.
We would also need https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/405585/?series=84394&rev=2 patch as well ?
Thanks,
Anshuman Gupta.
