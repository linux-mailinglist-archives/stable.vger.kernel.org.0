[ Upstream commit ae42f9288846353982e2eab181fb41e7fd8bf60f ]

We are racing the registering of .to_irq when probing the
i2c driver. This results in random failure of touchscreen
devices.

Following explains the race condition better.

[gpio driver] gpio driver registers gpio chip
[gpio consumer] gpio is acquired
[gpio consumer] gpiod_to_irq() fails with -ENXIO
[gpio driver] gpio driver registers irqchip
gpiod_to_irq works at this point, but -ENXIO is fatal

We could see the following errors in dmesg logs when gc->to_irq is NULL

[2.101857] i2c_hid i2c-FTS3528:00: HID over i2c has not been provided an Int IRQ
[2.101953] i2c_hid: probe of i2c-FTS3528:00 failed with error -22

To avoid this situation, defer probing until to_irq is registered.
Returning -EPROBE_DEFER would be the first step towards avoiding
the failure of devices due to the race in registration of .to_irq.
Final solution to this issue would be to avoid using gc irq members
until they are fully initialized.

This issue has been reported many times in past and people have been
using workarounds like changing the pinctrl_amd to built-in instead
of loading it as a module or by adding a softdep for pinctrl_amd into
the config file.
