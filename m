I don't see how any code could rely on not having DT and a timeout while 
attempting to enumerate and still expecting success (0). dwc3 in that 
case just assumes ulpi found and continues probe leading to 
non-functional dwc3 host.
I think a fix should be relatively simple to find and resolve 2 bads.
