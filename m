Interesting that only those two didn't get a proper arch specific
initialization. Could you check why? I assume init_cpu_to_node
doesn't see any CPU pointing at this node. Wondering why that would be
the case but that can be a bug in the affinity tables.

I will double check. There are changes required on the hotplug side. I
would like to see that this one doesn't blow up before diving there.

No, not really. AFAIU your issue has been reproducible during boot and
that seems to be fixed. I will work on the hotplug side of the things
and post something resembling a real patch soon. That would require also
memory hotplug testing.

Thanks for your help!
