In v2 (https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211207095726.169766-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/),
I did end up making wake_up_pollfree() into a function, which calls __wake_up()
and also checks that the queue became empty.

However, I didn't make wake_up_pollfree() remove the queue entries itself.  I
don't think that would be better, given that the purpose of POLLFREE is to
provide a notification that the queue is going away, not simply to remove the
queue entries.  In particular, we might want to cancel the poll request(s);
that's what aio poll does.  Also, we need to synchronize with other places where
the waitqueue is accessed, e.g. to remove an entry which requires taking the
waitqueue lock (see either aio poll or epoll).

Well, the documented user-visible behavior of epoll is that when a file is
closed, it is automatically removed from all epoll instances.  That precludes
epoll instances from holding references to the files which they are polling.

And the reason that POLLFREE needs to exist is that holding a file reference
isn't enough anyway, since in the case of signalfd and binder the waitqueue may
have a shorter lifetime.  If the file reference was enough, then aio poll
wouldn't need to handle POLLFREE.

That would be really nice, but unfortunately the current behavior is documented
in signalfd(2), for example:

"""
   fork(2) semantics
       After  a  fork(2),  the  child inherits a copy of the signalfd file de‚Äê
       scriptor.  A read(2) from the file descriptor in the child will  return
       information about signals queued to the child.
"""

With your proposed change to signalfd, the child would receive its parent's
signals via the signalfd, rather than its own signals.

It's maybe how signalfd should have worked originally.  I don't know whether it
is actually safe to change or not, but the fact that the current behavior is
specifically documented in the man page isn't too promising.

Also, changing signalfd by itself wouldn't allow removal of POLLFREE; binder
would have to be changed too.  I'm not a binder expert, but fixing binder
doesn't look super promising.  It looks pretty intentional that binder_poll()
operates on per-thread state, while the binder file description itself is a
per-process thing.
