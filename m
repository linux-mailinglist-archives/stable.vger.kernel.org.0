[ Upstream commit 1d3e0980782fbafaf93285779fd3905e4f866802 ]

Current code is based on the idea that the max number of SGL entries
also determines the max size of an I/O request.  While this idea was
true in older versions of the storvsc driver when SGL entry length
was limited to 4 Kbytes, commit 3d9c3dcc58e9 ("scsi: storvsc: Enable
scatterlist entry lengths > 4Kbytes") removed that limitation. It's
now theoretically possible for the block layer to send requests that
exceed the maximum size supported by Hyper-V. This problem doesn't
currently happen in practice because the block layer defaults to a
512 Kbyte maximum, while Hyper-V in Azure supports 2 Mbyte I/O sizes.
But some future configuration of Hyper-V could have a smaller max I/O
size, and the block layer could exceed that max.

Fix this by correctly setting max_sectors as well as sg_tablesize to
reflect the maximum I/O size that Hyper-V reports. While allowing
I/O sizes larger than the block layer default of 512 Kbytes doesnâ€™t
provide any noticeable performance benefit in the tests we ran, it's
still appropriate to report the correct underlying Hyper-V capabilities
to the Linux block layer.

Also tweak the virt_boundary_mask to reflect that the required
alignment derives from Hyper-V communication using a 4 Kbyte page size,
and not on the guest page size, which might be bigger (eg. ARM64).
