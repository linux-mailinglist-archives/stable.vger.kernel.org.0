[ Upstream commit 5ddbd77181dfca61b16d2e2222382ea65637f1b9 ]

ACPICA commit 29cc8dbc5463a93625bed87d7550a8bed8913bf4

create_buffer_field is a deferred op that is typically processed in
load pass 2. However, disassembly of control method contents walk the
parse tree with ACPI_PARSE_LOAD_PASS1 and AML_CREATE operators are
processed in a later walk. This is a problem when there is a control
method that has the same name as the AML_CREATE object. In this case,
any use of the name segment will be detected as a method call rather
than a reference to a buffer field. If this is detected as a method
call, it can result in a mal-formed parse tree if the control methods
have parameters.

This change in processing AML_CREATE ops earlier solves this issue by
inserting the named object in the ACPI namespace so that references
to this name would be detected as a name string rather than a method
call.
