This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    usb: xhci-mtk: fix broken streams issue on 0.96 xHCI

to my usb git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git
in the usb-testing branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will be merged to the usb-next branch sometime soon,
after it passes testing, and the merge window is open.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: usb: xhci-mtk: fix broken streams issue on 0.96 xHCI

The MediaTek 0.96 xHCI controller on some platforms does not
support bulk stream even HCCPARAMS says supporting, due to MaxPSASize
is set a default value 1 by mistake, here use XHCI_BROKEN_STREAMS
quirk to fix it.
