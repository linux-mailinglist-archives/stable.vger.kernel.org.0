commit 672d6ca758651f0ec12cd0d59787067a5bde1c96 upstream.

A lot of modern laptops use the Parade PS8461E MUX for eDP
switching. The MUX can operate in jitter cleaning mode or
redriver mode, the first one resulting in higher link
quality. The jitter cleaning mode needs to know the link
rate used and the MUX achieves this by snooping the
LINK_BW_SET, LINK_RATE_SELECT and SUPPORTED_LINK_RATES
DPCD accesses.

When the MUX is powered down (seems this can happen whenever
the display is turned off) it loses track of the snooped
link rates so when we do the LINK_RATE_SELECT write it no
longer knowns which link rate we're selecting, and thus it
falls back to the lower quality redriver mode. This results
in unstable high link rates (eg. usually 8.1Gbps link rate
no longer works correctly).

In order to avoid all that let's re-snoop SUPPORTED_LINK_RATES
from the sink at the start of every link training.

Unfortunately we don't have a way to detect the presence of
the MUX. It looks like the set of laptops equipped with this
MUX is fairly large and contains devices from multiple
manufacturers. It may also still be growing with new models.
So a quirk doesn't seem like a very easily maintainable
option, thus we shall attempt to do this unconditionally on
all machines that use LINK_RATE_SELECT. Hopefully this extra
DPCD read doesn't cause issues for any unaffected machine.
If that turns out to be the case we'll need to convert this
into a quirk in the future.
