Hello friend,

I am writing to you on behalf of my client Mr. Yusuf Habib. My name is 
Lukas, I am an investment portfolio Manager at MetLife, and my client 
(Mr. Yusuf Habib) has a large sum of money and he is looking for someone 
to help him manage the funds.

The Saudi government filed charges against my-client Mr. Yusuf Habib 
with the aim of keeping him in prison indefinitely. A variety of local 
and foreign politicians, civil activists, and journalists consider the 
process leading to the imprisonment of Mr. Yusuf to be politically 
motivated. My client's involvement and financial support for Jamal Ahmad 
Khashoggi posed the most challenge ever to Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud 
who happens to be the current Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. The money is 
currently deposited in the name of an existing Investment entity.

My client Mr. Yusuf Habib has presented a subtle offer that will need 
the help of a partner like you to complete successfully. Mr. Yusuf Habib 
is in a difficult situation, and he must immediately relocate certain 
sums of money and this must be done in such a way that it must not be 
tied to Mr. Yusuf Habib. The money is currently deposited in the name of 
an existing Investment entity.
Your role will be to:

[1]. Act as the original beneficiary of the funds.
[2]. Receive the funds into a business / private bank account.
[3]. Invest / Manage the funds outside of Turkey
[4]. Value of funds: 35 million US Dollars.

See the website below to understand better the problem Mr. Yusuf Habib 
faced all these past years:

Everything will be done legally to ensure the rights to the funds are 
transferred to you. If you agree to partner with Mr. Yusuf Habib in this 
partnership business proposal, he will compensate you with 35% percent 
of the total sum.
Terms will be discussed when you show interest and if you aren't 
interested and you know of someone looking for an investor, please give 
him / her my contact.

Should you prefer I re-contact you with more express facts. Then make 
your interest known.

Sincerely,
Lukas.
