Please do not feel disturbed for contacting  you in this regards, It
was based on the critical health condition I find mine self.  My names
  are Mrs. Monika John  Carlsen from Denmark wife, a widow and I=E2=80=99m
suffering from brain tumor disease and this illness has gotten to a
very bad stage, I married my husband for Ten years without any family
members and no child.  My husband died after a brief illness that
lasted for few days.Since the death of my husband, I decided not to
remarry again, When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of
($11.000.000 Eleven million dollars.) with the Bank. Presently this
money is still in bank. And My  Doctor told me that I don't have much
time to live because my illness has gotten to a very bad stage, Having
known my condition I  decided to entrust over the deposited  fund
under your custody to take care of the less-privileged ones therein
your country or position, which i believe that you will utilize this
money the way I am going to instruct herein.

However all I need and required from you is your sincerity and ability
to carry out the transaction successfully and fulfill my final wish in
 implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that the bank
finally release and transfer the fund into your bank account in your
country even before I die here in the hospital, because my present
health condition is very critical at the moment everything needs to be
process rapidly as soon as possible.

It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment
Manager/Partner with 35 % percent of the total fund for your effort in
  handling the transaction, 5 % percent for any expenses or processing
charges fee that will involve during this process while 60% of the
fund will be Invested into the charity project there in your country
for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileges ones.

Meanwhile I am waiting for your prompt respond, if only you are
interested for further details of the transaction and execution of
this   humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the
merciful compassionate.

May God bless you and your family.
Regards,Mrs. Monika John Carlsen
written from Hospital.
