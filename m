will be maintained.
My dear, all I need and required from you is your sincerity and
ability to carry out the transaction and fulfill my final wish in
implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that the bank

your country even before I die here in the hospital, because my
present health condition is very critical at the moment everything
need to be process rapidly as soon as possible.
