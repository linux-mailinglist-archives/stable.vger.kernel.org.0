commit 7492ffc90fa126afb67d4392d56cb4134780194a upstream.

The CONSOLE_POLLING mode is used for tools like k(g)db. In this kind of
setup, it is often sharing a serial device with the normal system console.
This is usually no problem because the polling helpers can consume input
values directly (when in kgdb context) and the normal Linux handlers can
only consume new input values after kgdb switched back.

This is not true anymore when RX DMA is enabled for UARTDM controllers.
Single input values can no longer be received correctly. Instead following
seems to happen:

* on 1. input, some old input is read (continuously)
* on 2. input, two old inputs are read (continuously)
* on 3. input, three old input values are read (continuously)
* on 4. input, 4 previous inputs are received

This repeats then for each group of 4 input values.

This behavior changes slightly depending on what state the controller was
when the first input was received. But this makes working with kgdb
basically impossible because control messages are always corrupted when
kgdboc tries to parse them.

RX DMA should therefore be off when CONSOLE_POLLING is enabled to avoid
these kind of problems. No such problem was noticed for TX DMA.
