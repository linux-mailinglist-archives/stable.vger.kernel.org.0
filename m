Subject: [PATCH] PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Fix definitions of reserved bits
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Some bits in PCI_EXP registers are reserved for non-root ports. Driver
pci-bridge-emul.c implements PCIe Root Port device therefore it should not
allow setting reserved bits of registers.

Properly define non-reserved bits for all PCI_EXP registers.
