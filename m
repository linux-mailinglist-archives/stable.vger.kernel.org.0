Hello,

We ran automated tests on a patchset that was proposed for merging into this
kernel tree. The patches were applied to:

       Kernel repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
            Commit: aec3002d07fd - Linux 4.19.56

The results of these automated tests are provided below.

    Overall result: PASSED
             Merge: OK
           Compile: OK
             Tests: OK


Please reply to this email if you have any questions about the tests that we
ran or if you have any suggestions on how to make future tests more effective.

Merge testing
-------------

We cloned this repository and checked out the following commit:

  Repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
  Commit: aec3002d07fd - Linux 4.19.56


We grabbed the 3773c1b5b5c3 commit of the stable queue repository.

We then merged the patchset with `git am`:

  perf-ui-helpline-use-strlcpy-as-a-shorter-form-of-strncpy-explicit-set-nul.patch
  perf-help-remove-needless-use-of-strncpy.patch
  perf-header-fix-unchecked-usage-of-strncpy.patch
  arm64-don-t-unconditionally-add-wno-psabi-to-kbuild_cflags.patch

Compile testing

Waived tests (marked with 🚧)
-----------------------------
This test run included waived tests. Such tests are executed but their results
are not taken into account. Tests are waived when their results are not
reliable enough, e.g. when they're just introduced or are being fixed.
