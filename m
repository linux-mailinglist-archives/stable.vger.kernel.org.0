So this has historically caused problems since the linear kernel map has 
been accessed while prefetching, even if it's never used. Some 
processors like AMD athlon actually even wrote back the prefetched 
contents without ever using it.

Also the linear kernel map could be cached somewhere because of the 
page's previous usage. (hibernationÂ  for example?)

I think it might be safe for some integrated graphics where the driver 
maintainers can guarantee that it's safe on all particular processors 
used with that driver, but then IMO it should be moved out to those drivers.

Other drivers needing write-combine shouldn't really use shmem.

So again, to fix the regression, could we revert 0be895893607f 
("drm/shmem: switch shmem helper to &drm_gem_object_funcs.mmap") or does 
that have other implications?
