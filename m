Subject: [PATCH 1/3] dma-buf/sw_sync: Avoid recursive lock during fence signal.

Calltree:
  timeline_fence_release
  drm_sched_entity_wakeup
  dma_fence_signal_locked
  sync_timeline_signal
  sw_sync_ioctl

Releasing the reference to the fence in the fence signal callback
seems reasonable to me, so this patch avoids the locking issue in
sw_sync.

d3862e44daa7 ("dma-buf/sw-sync: Fix locking around sync_timeline lists")
fixed the recursive locking issue but caused an use-after-free. Later
d3c6dd1fb30d ("dma-buf/sw_sync: Synchronize signal vs syncpt free")
fixed the use-after-free but reintroduced the recursive locking issue.

In this attempt we avoid the use-after-free still because the release
function still always locks, and outside of the locking region in the
signal function we have properly refcounted references.

We furthermore also avoid the recurive lock by making sure that either:

1) We have a properly refcounted reference, preventing the signal from
   triggering the release function inside the locked region.
2) The refcount was already zero, and hence nobody will be able to trigger
   the release function from the signal function.

v2: Move dma_fence_signal() into second loop in preparation to moving
the callback out of the timeline obj->lock.
