I think the issue is that >here< a concurrent reader in interrupt context
can take the lock and release it again, but we could speculate reads from
the critical section up over the later release and up before the control
dependency here...

> +	} while (!atomic_try_cmpxchg_relaxed(&lock->cnts, &cnt, _QW_LOCKED));

... and then this cmpxchg() will succeed, so our speculated stale reads
could be used.

*HOWEVER*

Speculating a read should be fine in the face of a concurrent _reader_,
so for this to be an issue it implies that the reader is also doing some
(atomic?) updates.
