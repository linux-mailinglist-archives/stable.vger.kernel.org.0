Agreed...  I believe cmogstored has always had a bug in the way
it uses epoll_pwait because it failed to check interrupts if:

a) an FD is ready + interrupt
b) epoll_pwait returns 0 on interrupt

The bug remains in userspace for a), which I will fix by adding
an interrupt check when an FD is ready.  The window is very
small for a) and difficult to trigger, and also in a rare code
path.

The b) case is the kernel bug introduced in 854a6ed56839a40f
("signal: Add restore_user_sigmask()").

I don't think there's any disagreement that b) is a kernel bug.

So the confusion is for a), and POSIX is not clear w.r.t. how
pselect/poll works when there's both FD readiness and an
interrupt.

Thus I'm inclined to believe *select/*poll/epoll_*wait should
follow POSIX read() semantics:

       If a read() is interrupted by a signal before it reads any data, it shall
       return âˆ’1 with errno set to [EINTR].

       If  a  read()  is  interrupted by a signal after it has successfully read
       some data, it shall return the number of bytes read.

I'm not sure that's necessary and it would cause delays in
signal handling.
