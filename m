Compile testing
---------------

We compiled the kernel for 4 architectures:

Hardware testing
----------------

We booted each kernel and ran the following tests:

  aarch64:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

  ppc64le:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

  s390x:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

  x86_64:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.
