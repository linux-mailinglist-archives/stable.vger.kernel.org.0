commit 3489dbb696d25602aea8c3e669a6d43b76bd5358 upstream.

Patch series "Fixes for hugetlb mapcount at most 1 for shared PMDs".

This issue of mapcount in hugetlb pages referenced by shared PMDs was
discussed in [1].  The following two patches address user visible behavior
caused by this issue.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Y9BF+OCdWnCSilEu@monkey/


This patch (of 2):

A hugetlb page will have a mapcount of 1 if mapped by multiple processes
via a shared PMD.  This is because only the first process increases the
map count, and subsequent processes just add the shared PMD page to their
page table.

page_mapcount is being used to decide if a hugetlb page is shared or
private in /proc/PID/smaps.  Pages referenced via a shared PMD were
incorrectly being counted as private.

To fix, check for a shared PMD if mapcount is 1.  If a shared PMD is found
count the hugetlb page as shared.  A new helper to check for a shared PMD
is added.
