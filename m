Hello,

We ran automated tests on a patchset that was proposed for merging into thi=
s
kernel tree. The patches were applied to:

       Kernel repo: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/=
linux.git
            Commit: 5d6121095143 - Linux 5.3.12

The results of these automated tests are provided below.

    Overall result: FAILED (see details below)
             Merge: OK
           Compile: OK
             Tests: FAILED

All kernel binaries, config files, and logs are available for download here=
:

  https://artifacts.cki-project.org/pipelines/300198

One or more kernel tests failed:

    aarch64:
     =E2=9D=8C Usex - version 1.9-29

    x86_64:
     =E2=9D=8C Boot test

We hope that these logs can help you find the problem quickly. For the full
detail on our testing procedures, please scroll to the bottom of this messa=
ge.

Please reply to this email if you have any questions about the tests that w=
e
ran or if you have any suggestions on how to make future tests more effecti=
ve.

Merge testing
-------------

We cloned this repository and checked out the following commit:

  Repo: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
  Commit: 5d6121095143 - Linux 5.3.12


We grabbed the e6b1008717a6 commit of the stable queue repository.

We then merged the patchset with `git am`:

  net-cdc_ncm-signedness-bug-in-cdc_ncm_set_dgram_size.patch
  block-bfq-deschedule-empty-bfq_queues-not-referred-by-any-process.patch
  mm-memory_hotplug-don-t-access-uninitialized-memmaps-in-shrink_pgdat_span=
.patch
  mm-memory_hotplug-fix-updating-the-node-span.patch
  arm64-uaccess-ensure-pan-is-re-enabled-after-unhandled-uaccess-fault.patc=
h

Compile testing
---------------

We compiled the kernel for 4 architectures:

    aarch64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg

    ppc64le:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg

    s390x:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg

    x86_64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=3D1 targz-pkg


Hardware testing
----------------
We booted each kernel and ran the following tests:

  aarch64:
    Host 1:
       =E2=9C=85 Boot test
       =E2=9C=85 lvm thinp sanity

       =E2=9C=85 stress: stress-ng

  ppc64le:

arked
    with =E2=9A=A1=E2=9A=A1=E2=9A=A1) from running on this architecture.
    This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

    =F0=9F=92=9A Pull requests are welcome for new tests or improvements to=
 existing tests!

Waived tests
------------
If the test run included waived tests, they are marked with =F0=9F=9A=A7. S=
uch tests are
executed but their results are not taken into account. Tests are waived whe=
n
their results are not reliable enough, e.g. when they're just introduced or=
 are
being fixed.

Testing timeout
---------------
We aim to provide a report within reasonable timeframe. Tests that haven't
finished running are marked with =E2=8F=B1. Reports for non-upstream kernel=
s have
a Beaker recipe linked to next to each host.
