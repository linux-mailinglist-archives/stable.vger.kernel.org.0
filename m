Greetings to you and your family.

My name is Mr. Kone Compaore, the auditing general with the bank,
Africa Develop bank (ADB) Ouagadougou, Burkina

Faso, in West Africa. I am contacting you to seek our honesty and
sincere cooperation in confidential manner to

transfer the sum of 15.5 (Fifteen million five hundred thousand
Dollars) to your existing or new bank account.

This money belongs to one of our bank client, a Libyan oil exporter
who was working with the former Libyan

government; I learn t that he was killed by the revolutionary forces
since October 2011. Our bank is planning to

transfer this entire fund into the government public treasury as
unclaimed fund if nobody comes to claim the money

from our bank after four years without account activities .

We did not know each other before, but due to the fact that the
deceased is a foreigner, the bank will welcome any

claim from a foreigner without any suspect, that is why I decided to
look for someone whim I can trust to come and

claim the fund from our bank.

I will endorse your name in the deceased client file here in my office
which will indicate to that the deceased is

your legal joint account business partner or family member next of kin
to the deceased and officially the bank will

transfer the fund to your bank account within seven working days in
accordance to our banking inheritance rules and

fund claim regulation.

I will share 40% for you and 60% for me after the fund is transferred
to your bank account, we need to act fast to

complete this transaction within seven days. I will come to your
country to collect my share after the fund is

transferred to your bank account in your country. I hope that you will
not disappoint me after the fund is

transferred to your bank account in your country.

Waiting for your urgent response today
Yours sincerely
Kone Compaore
