I sent an email to you yesterday but since I did not get a response,
I thought probably you did not receive it so I decided to send it 
again and hopefully I will get a response this time around.

I am a secret admirer and would like to explore the opportunity to 
learn more about each other. I know it is strange to contact you 
this way and I hope you can forgive me. I am a shy person and 
this is the only way I know I could get your attention. I just want 
to know what you think and my intention is not to offend you.
I hope we can be friends if that is what you want, although I wish 
to be more than just a friend. I know you have a few questions to 
ask and I hope I can satisfy some of your curiosity with a few 
answers.

I believe in the saying that &#039;to the world you are just one person, 
but to someone special you are the world&#039;. All I want is love, 
romantic care and attention from a special companion which I am
hoping would be you.

I hope this message will be the beginning of a long term 
communication between us, simply send a reply to this message, it 
will make me happy.


Hugs and kisses,

Marion.
