Please pick the following fixes to brcmfmac for the 4.14, 4.19, and 5.0
stable branches:

1b5e2423164b brcmfmac: assure SSID length from firmware is limited
a4176ec356c7 brcmfmac: add subtype check for event handling in data path

They are also needed for earlier branches, but they don't apply cleanly
so I will send patches later.

Ben.
