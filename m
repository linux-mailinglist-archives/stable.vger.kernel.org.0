MODERN ACADEMIC EDITING 
www.modernacademicedit.com


Don't allow poor spelling or poor formatting deny your manuscript’s chance of publication in high-quality journals.
Don't become one of the hundreds of authors who have their manuscripts rejected due to spelling, grammatical, typographical or punctuation errors.
Hence, what Are You Waiting For?
Modern Academic Editing is the most trusted academic proofreading and editing services for you.

Dear Colleague,
MODERN ACADEMIC EDITING is the Number 1 choice for native and non-native English speaking students, professionals, authors, and individuals from around the globe, for ensuring the highest-possible quality of editing and confirming that ideas are communicated clearly and effectively. Thousands of academic authors and researchers have already experienced our specialist Proofreading services now it’s your turn! Therefore, we call on writers and authors in all academic fields to submit their manuscripts for editing and proofreading. We have observed, over and over again, that incorrect grammar, punctuation, spelling or syntax often leads to a negative response to manuscripts from reviewers. Using an online grammar correction service is not always sufficient to highlight mistakes. Hence, we advise that authors should send their manuscript(s) to us for accurate grammatical proofreading and editing.

We invite you to submit your articles and theses (MS-Word document) as e-mail attachments to our Editorial Office at: articles@modernacaemicedit.com or modernacademicedit@gmail.com. Manuscripts are expected to be in double line spacing (Still depends on the journal's format).Upon receipt of your manuscript, an acknowledgment letter, including the manuscript number and the payment charges, will be sent to the corresponding author.

Our charges are as follows:
