Hi Greg,

There are two more patches about the ZONE_DMA[32] changes, especially 
the second one, both them need be backported, thanks.

791ab8b2e3db - arm64: Ignore any DMA offsets in the max_zone_phys() 
calculation
2687275a5843 - arm64: Force NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS if crashkernel reservation 
is required
