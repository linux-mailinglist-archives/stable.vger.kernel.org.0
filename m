Callers:
intel_fb_max_stride -> intel_framebuffer_init, not used if no display
intel_fb_stride_alignment,
	0 -> intel_tile_size() alignment. ok ->
	intel_framebuffer_init, not used as no display

-> i915_gem_dumb_create -> args->pitch = PAGE_ALIGN()

Ok, not as horrible as I feared when I saw return 0 from max_stride!
