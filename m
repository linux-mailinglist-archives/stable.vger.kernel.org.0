Hello,

My name is Reem E. Al-Hashimi,I am writing to you to stand as my partner to receive my share of gratification from foreign companies whom I helped during the bidding exercise towards the Dubai World Expo 2020 Committee.

Am a women and serving as a Minister, there is a limit to my personal income and investment level and For this reason, I cannot receive such a huge sum back to my country or my personal account, so an agreement was reached with the foreign companies to direct the gratifications to an open beneficiary account with a financial institution where it will be possible for me to instruct further transfer of the fund to a third party account for investment purpose which is the reason i contacted you to receive the fund as my partner for investment in your country.

The amount is valued at Eu 47,745,533.00 with a financial institution waiting my instruction for further transfer to a destination account as soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and invest the fund, I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount and you will also get benefit from the investment.

If you can handle the fund in a good investment. reply on this email only: reem.alhashimi@kakao.com

Regards,
Ms. Reem
