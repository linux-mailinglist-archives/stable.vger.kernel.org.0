Hello,

I am reaching out to provide awareness for a part-time career. We are currently sourcing for representatives in Europe to work from home to act as our company's regional business representative in that region. It will by no means interfere with your current job or business.

Kindly email me for detailed information.

Regards,
Bleiholder Novak
