Note the real thing that changed for GCC 10 at -O2 is that -O2
now includes -finline-functions which means GCC considers inlining
of functions not marked with 'inline' at -O2.  To counter code-size
growth and tune that back to previous levels the inlining limits
in effect at -O2 have been lowered.

Note this has been done based on analyzing larger C++ code and obviously
not because the kernel would benefit (IIRC kernel folks like 'inline'
to behave as written and thus rather may dislike the change to default to
-finline-functions).

And I think that's completely sensible.  I would not recommend
to use -O3 for the kernel.  Somehow feeding back profile data
might help - though getting such data at all and with enough
coverage is probably hard.

As you said in the followup I wouldn't recommend tweaking GCCs
defaults for the various --param affecting inlining.  The behavior
with this is not consistent across releases.
