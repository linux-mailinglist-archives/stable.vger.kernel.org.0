From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit da791a667536bf8322042e38ca85d55a78d3c273 upstream.

This patch comes directly from an origin patch (commit
9c3f3986036760c48a92f04b36774aa9f63673f80) in v4.9.

Stefan reported, that the glibc tst-robustpi4 test case fails
occasionally. That case creates the following race between
sys_exit() and sys_futex_lock_pi():

 CPU0				CPU1

 sys_exit()			sys_futex()
  do_exit()			 futex_lock_pi()
   exit_signals(tsk)		  No waiters:
    tsk->flags |= PF_EXITING;	  *uaddr == 0x00000PID
  mm_release(tsk)		  Set waiter bit
   exit_robust_list(tsk) {	  *uaddr = 0x80000PID;
      Set owner died		  attach_to_pi_owner() {
    *uaddr = 0xC0000000;	   tsk = get_task(PID);
   }				   if (!tsk->flags & PF_EXITING) {
  ...				     attach();
  tsk->flags |= PF_EXITPIDONE;	   } else {
				     if (!(tsk->flags & PF_EXITPIDONE))
				       return -EAGAIN;
				     return -ESRCH; <--- FAIL
				   }

ESRCH is returned all the way to user space, which triggers the glibc test
case assert. Returning ESRCH unconditionally is wrong here because the user
space value has been changed by the exiting task to 0xC0000000, i.e. the
FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit is set and the futex PID value has been cleared. This
is a valid state and the kernel has to handle it, i.e. taking the futex.

Cure it by rereading the user space value when PF_EXITING and PF_EXITPIDONE
is set in the task which 'owns' the futex. If the value has changed, let
the kernel retry the operation, which includes all regular sanity checks
and correctly handles the FUTEX_OWNER_DIED case.

If it hasn't changed, then return ESRCH as there is no way to distinguish
this case from malfunctioning user space. This happens when the exiting
task did not have a robust list, the robust list was corrupted or the user
space value in the futex was simply bogus.
