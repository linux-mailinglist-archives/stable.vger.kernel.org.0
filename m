commit 780f66e59231fcf882f36c63f287252ee47cc75a upstream.

Improve comments in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() to describe why
we don't need to clear the buffer_mapped bit for freeing file mapping
buffers whose page mapping is NULL.

Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200217112706.20085-1-yi.zhang@huawei.com
Fixes: c96dceeabf76 ("jbd2: do not clear the BH_Mapped flag when forgetting a metadata buffer")
