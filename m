[ Upstream commit 1c200e63d055ec0125e44a5e386b9b78aada7eb3 ]

Currently it's possible that a thread on PPC64 LE has its endianness
flipped inadvertently to Big-Endian resulting in a crash once the process
is back from the signal handler.

If giveup_all() is called when regs->msr has the bits MSR.FP and MSR.VEC
disabled (and hence MSR.VSX disabled too) it returns without calling
check_if_tm_restore_required() which copies regs->msr to ckpt_regs->msr if
the process caught a signal whilst in transactional mode. Then once in
setup_tm_sigcontexts() MSR from ckpt_regs.msr is used, but since
check_if_tm_restore_required() was not called previuosly, gp_regs[PT_MSR]
gets a copy of invalid MSR bits as MSR in ckpt_regs was not updated from
regs->msr and so is zeroed. Later when leaving the signal handler once in
sys_rt_sigreturn() the TS bits of gp_regs[PT_MSR] are checked to determine
if restore_tm_sigcontexts() must be called to pull in the correct MSR state
into the user context. Because TS bits are zeroed
restore_tm_sigcontexts() is never called and MSR restored from the user
context on returning from the signal handler has the MSR.LE (the endianness
bit) forced to zero (Big-Endian). That leads, for instance, to 'nop' being
treated as an illegal instruction in the following sequence:

	tbegin.
	beq	1f
	trap
	tend.
1:	nop

on PPC64 LE machines and the process dies just after returning from the
signal handler.

PPC64 BE is also affected but in a subtle way since forcing Big-Endian on
a BE machine does not change the endianness.

This commit fixes the issue described above by ensuring that once in
setup_tm_sigcontexts() the MSR used is from regs->msr instead of from
ckpt_regs->msr and by ensuring that we pull in only the MSR.FP, MSR.VEC,
and MSR.VSX bits from ckpt_regs->msr.

The fix was tested both on LE and BE machines and no regression regarding
the powerpc/tm selftests was observed.
