commit d953540430c5af57f5de97ea9e36253908204027 upstream.

Drop pending exceptions and events queued for re-injection when leaving
nested guest mode, even if the "exit" is due to VM-Fail, SMI, or forced
by host userspace.  Failure to purge events could result in an event
belonging to L2 being injected into L1.

This _should_ never happen for VM-Fail as all events should be blocked by
nested_run_pending, but it's possible if KVM, not the L1 hypervisor, is
the source of VM-Fail when running vmcs02.

SMI is a nop (barring unknown bugs) as recognition of SMI and thus entry
to SMM is blocked by pending exceptions and re-injected events.

Forced exit is definitely buggy, but has likely gone unnoticed because
userspace probably follows the forced exit with KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS (or
some other ioctl() that purges the queue).
