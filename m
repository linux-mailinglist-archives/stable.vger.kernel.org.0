Dear Friend,
Please permit me to share with you, my desire to go into this Godly
business partnership with you as=C2=A0I believe that You and I can
cooperate together in this humanitarian social project only for the
glory and honor of God.  I am Mrs. Dee Parson's,=C2=A0a dying widow
hospitalized undergoing treatment for brain tumor disease. Because of
this reason i decided to seek for your sincerity and ability to carry
out this transaction and fulfill my final wish in implementing the
charitable social project in your country as it requires absolute
trust and devotion without any failure, which i believe that you are a
reliable person and you will not expose or betray this trust and
confident that I'm about to entrust on you. My late husband made a
substantial deposit with the bank with my name as the beneficiary
which I decided to hand over and entrust the sum of ($ 12,500,000.00,
Dollars) in the account to you to invest into the humanitarian social
project. Based on my present health status as I'm permanently
indisposed to handle finances or any financial related project,
following my diagnoses. Having known my present health condition, I
decided to seek for your assistance in reclaiming the fund for the
support and mutual benefit of the less privileged as I don't have any
relation, and I have been touched by God to donate from what I have to
the needy because it will be a great loss in spending the fund on my
health treatment hence my doctor has confirmed to me that i will not
survive this illness.

This is the reason I contacted you for your support and help to stand
as my rightful beneficiary and claim the money for humanitarian
purposes for the mutual benefits of the less privileged ones. Because
If the money remains unclaimed with the bank after my death, those
greedy bank executives will place the money as an unclaimed Fund and
share it for their selfish and worthless ventures. It will be my
pleasure to compensate you with part of the money as my Investment
Manager/Partner for your effort in handling the transaction, while the
remaining amount of the money will be invested into the charity
project there in your country.

If you are willing to accept my offer and do exactly as I have stated
above. You should immediately get back to me for further details of
the transaction.

Best regards and God bless you.
