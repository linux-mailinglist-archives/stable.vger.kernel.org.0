[ Upstream commit 43cc64e5221cc6741252b64bc4531dd1eefb733d ]

The busy timeout that is computed for each erase/trim/discard operation,
can become quite long and may thus exceed the host->max_busy_timeout. If
that becomes the case, mmc_do_erase() converts from using an R1B response
to an R1 response, as to prevent the host from doing HW busy detection.

However, it has turned out that some hosts requires an R1B response no
matter what, so let's respect that via checking MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY. Note
that, if the R1B gets enforced, the host becomes fully responsible of
managing the needed busy timeout, in one way or the other.
