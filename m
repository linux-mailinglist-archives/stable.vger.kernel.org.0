Please stick this in the commit message, preferably annotated a bit like
Peter's example to show the READ_ONCE() being speculated.

Just been thinking about this, but I don't see an issue here because
everybody is queuing the same way (i.e. we don't have a mechanism to jump
the queue like we do for qrwlock) and the tail portion of the lock word
isn't susceptible to ABA. That is, once we're at the head of the queue
and we've seen the lock become unlocked via atomic_cond_read_acquire(),
then we know we hold it.

So qspinlock looks fine to me, but I'd obviously value anybody else's
opinion on that.
