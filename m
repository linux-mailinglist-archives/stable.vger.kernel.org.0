commit d18760560593e5af921f51a8c9b64b6109d634c2 upstream.

Add a helper function fscrypt_symlink_getattr() which will be called
from the various filesystems' ->getattr() methods to read and decrypt
the target of encrypted symlinks in order to report the correct st_size.

Detailed explanation:

As required by POSIX and as documented in various man pages, st_size for
a symlink is supposed to be the length of the symlink target.
Unfortunately, st_size has always been wrong for encrypted symlinks
because st_size is populated from i_size from disk, which intentionally
contains the length of the encrypted symlink target.  That's slightly
greater than the length of the decrypted symlink target (which is the
symlink target that userspace usually sees), and usually won't match the
length of the no-key encoded symlink target either.

This hadn't been fixed yet because reporting the correct st_size would
require reading the symlink target from disk and decrypting or encoding
it, which historically has been considered too heavyweight to do in
->getattr().  Also historically, the wrong st_size had only broken a
test (LTP lstat03) and there were no known complaints from real users.
(This is probably because the st_size of symlinks isn't used too often,
and when it is, typically it's for a hint for what buffer size to pass
to readlink() -- which a slightly-too-large size still works for.)

However, a couple things have changed now.  First, there have recently
been complaints about the current behavior from real users:

- Breakage in rpmbuild:
  https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/1682
  https://github.com/google/fscrypt/issues/305

- Breakage in toybox cpio:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/toybox@lists.landley.net/msg07193.html

- Breakage in libgit2: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/189629152
  (on Android public issue tracker, requires login)

Second, we now cache decrypted symlink targets in ->i_link.  Therefore,
taking the performance hit of reading and decrypting the symlink target
in ->getattr() wouldn't be as big a deal as it used to be, since usually
it will just save having to do the same thing later.

Also note that eCryptfs ended up having to read and decrypt symlink
targets in ->getattr() as well, to fix this same issue; see
commit 3a60a1686f0d ("eCryptfs: Decrypt symlink target for stat size").

So, let's just bite the bullet, and read and decrypt the symlink target
in ->getattr() in order to report the correct st_size.  Add a function
fscrypt_symlink_getattr() which the filesystems will call to do this.

(Alternatively, we could store the decrypted size of symlinks on-disk.
But there isn't a great place to do so, and encryption is meant to hide
the original size to some extent; that property would be lost.)
