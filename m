Commit subject: usb: dwc3: gadget: Don't clear flags before transfer ended
Commit ID: a114c4ca64bd522aec1790c7e5c60c882f699d8f
Apply to: at least 4.19 stable, and 5.4 stable if possible. Note that all kernels from v4.18-rc1 up to 5.7-rc1 are affected.

Why apply it:
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a114c4ca64bd522aec1790c7e5c60c882f699d8f> fixes <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6d8a019614f3a7630e0a2c1be4bf1cfc23acf56e>. Without this fix the built-in USB function source/sink test module fails to work with isochronous endpoints [1]. A side-effect of setting dep->flags = DWC3_EP_ENABLED; in dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_completed_requests() as part of disabling an ep is that a subsequent attempt to enable the endpoint will skip __dwc3_gadget_ep_enable() effectively leaving the ep disabled.

[1] Our gadget driver on TI AM5729 fails to work exactly like the built-in USB function source/sink test module when switching to alternate interface 1 because of the issue described above.

TI is currently using 4.19 and 5.4 stable kernels as the basis for their processor SDK kernels for their AM57x SoC and may switch to 5.4 stable at a later time. Thank you.
