My Dearest,

My name is Mrs. Nicole Pauline, from Toulouse France. I have been
suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that I have
just a short time to live. For the past Twelve years, I have being
dealing on gold exportation, before falling ill due to the Cancer.

My late husband, Dr. Benoit Kabore, a retired diplomat and one time
minister of mines and Power in the republic of Burkina Faso made a lot
of money from the sales of Gold and cotton while he was a minister,
but we had no child of our own. Later my husband realized through a
powerful man of God that it was evil course instituted by his brother
in other to inherit his wealth, but before then it was too late, I and
my husband agreed that he should remarry another wife but our religion
did not permit it, while planning this my husband s brother heard it
and they planned and killed my husband at the age of 56, he died in
the month of September 2007 Now that I am very sick and according to
the doctor, will not survive the sickness. The worst of it all is that
I do not have any family members or children to inherit my wealth.

I am writing this letter now through the help of the computer beside
my sick bed. I have $6.5 Million US Dollars deposited in Coris Bank
International here in Burkina Faso and I am willing to instruct my
bank to transfer the said fund to you as my foreign Trustee.

You will apply to the bank that they should release the fund to you,
but you will assure me that you will take 50% of the fund and give 50%
to the orphanages home in your country for my soul to rest after I
have gone. In my next email, I will send you the copy of the
certificate of Deposit which will enable you apply to the bank and
receive the money with no case.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Nicole Pauline,
