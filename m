The initial value mentioned in the manual makes sense to me.
Of course when using that, #defines should be added for bits used, to
avoid writing the magical value "0x80ff0001".

Initially, the "ff" part worried me.  Fortunately some archaeology learned
me that these bits where called "NFTS" in the SH7786 Hardware User's
Manual, and used to specify the number of Fast Training Sequences to
be transferred when the MAC returns from L0 to L0s (6--255).

arch/sh/drivers/pci/pcie-sh7786.c seems to be aware of this:

        /*
         * Set fast training sequences to the maximum 255,
         * and enable MAC data scrambling.
         */
        data = pci_read_reg(chan, SH4A_PCIEMACCTLR);
        data &= ~PCIEMACCTLR_SCR_DIS;
        data |= (0xff << 16);
        pci_write_reg(chan, data, SH4A_PCIEMACCTLR);

No idea why this was deemed not-to-be-modified by the user later
(as of R-Car H1).
