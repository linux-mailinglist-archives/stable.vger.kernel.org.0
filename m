I know this contact will be so strange to you,i am contacting you
independently of my investigation in my bank and no one is informed of
this communication. I need your urgent assistance in transferring the
sum of $11.6million dollars to your private account,that belongs to
one of our foreign customer who died a longtime with his supposed NEXT
OF KIN since July 22, 2003.The money has been here in our Bank lying
dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.

I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased
customer , the Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay
more than 18years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank
treasury account as unclaimed fund.I am ready to share with you 40%
for you and 60% will be kept for me, by indicating your interest i
will send you the full details on how the business will be executed.
Mr.Jonah
