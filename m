[Adding a few pople to the list of recipients that were involved in
developing the culprit; also CCing the regression list, as it should be
in the loop for regressions:

[TLDR: I'm adding this report to the list of tracked Linux kernel
regressions; the text you find below is based on a few templates
paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar form.

FWIW, that's 7176a6a8982d ("dmaengine: at_hdmac: Don't start
transactions at tx_submit level") in mainline.

Kristof Havasi: would be good to know if this is something that happens
with recent mainline as well, because if not it might be something the
stable team needs to handle.

Thanks for the report. To be sure the issue doesn't fall through the
cracks unnoticed, I'm adding it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression
tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced 77b97ef4908aa
#regzbot title dmaengine: at_hdmac: receiving data through the RS485
interface broke
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (the parent of this mail). See page linked in footer for
details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
