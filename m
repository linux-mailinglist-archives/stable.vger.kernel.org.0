[ Upstream commit 9fa24404f5044967753a6cd3e5e36f57686bec6e ]

powerpc/64 can boot on a non-zero SMP processor id. Initially, the boot
CPU is said to be "assumed to be 0" until early_init_devtree() discovers
the id from the device tree. That is not a good description because the
assumption can be wrong and that has to be handled, the better
description is that 0 is used as a placeholder, and things are fixed
after the real id is discovered.

smp_processor_id() is set to the boot cpuid, but task_cpu(current) is
not, which causes the smp_processor_id() == task_cpu(current) invariant
to be broken until init_idle() in sched_init().

This is quite fragile and could lead to subtle bugs in future. One bug
is that validate_sp_size uses task_cpu() to get the process stack, so
any stack trace from the booting CPU between early_init_devtree()
and sched_init() will have problems. Early on paca_ptrs[0] will be
poisoned, so that can cause machine checks dereferencing that memory
in real mode. Later, validating the current stack pointer against the
idle task of a different secondary will probably cause no stack trace
to be printed.

Fix this by setting thread_info->cpu right after smp_processor_id() is
set to the boot cpuid.
