Hello,

We ran automated tests on a patchset that was proposed for merging into this
kernel tree. The patches were applied to:

       Kernel repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
            Commit: 768292d05361 - Linux 4.19.50

The results of these automated tests are provided below.

    Overall result: PASSED
             Merge: OK
           Compile: OK
             Tests: OK


We hope that these logs can help you find the problem quickly. For the full
detail on our testing procedures, please scroll to the bottom of this message.

Please reply to this email if you have any questions about the tests that we
ran or if you have any suggestions on how to make future tests more effective.

Merge testing
-------------

We cloned this repository and checked out the following commit:

  Repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
  Commit: 768292d05361 - Linux 4.19.50


We then merged the patchset with `git am`:


Compile testing
---------------

We compiled the kernel for 4 architectures:

  aarch64:
    build options: -j20 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 targz-pkg
    configuration: https://artifacts.cki-project.org/builds/aarch64/kernel-stable_queue_4.19-aarch64-768292d053619b2725b846ed2bf556bf40f43de2.config

Hardware testing
----------------

We booted each kernel and ran the following tests:

  aarch64:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

  ppc64le:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

  s390x:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.

  x86_64:

    âš¡ Internal infrastructure issues prevented one or more tests from running
    on this architecture. This is not the fault of the kernel that was tested.
