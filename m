Dear Partner,

I am Dr. Benard Zoungrana,Managing Director of (BOA) Bank Of Africa .I
write you this proposal in good faith hoping that I will rely on you
in a business transaction that require absolute confidentiality and of
great interest and benefit to our both families.

In 1999,one Mr. Raymond Beck, is an American, a physician and
industrialist, he died without having any beneficiary to his assets
including his account here in Burkina Faso which he opened in a Bank
of Africa in the year 1994 as his personal savings for the purpose of
expansion and development of his company before his untimely death in
1999, made a fixed deposit for 36 months, valued at $50,500,000.00
with my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position
of Managing Director. Sadly Mr. Raymond Beck was among the death
victims in the 1999 plane crash that left over 47 people dead while he
was on business trip.

Since the last quarter of 2010 until today, the management of my bank
has been finding means to reach him so as ascertain if he will roll
over the Deposit or have the contract sum withdrawn. When I discovered
that this will happen, I have tried to think up a procedure to
preserve this fund and use the proceeds for business.

Some directors here have been trying to find out from me the
information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it
closed because, I know that if they become aware that Mr. Raymond Beck
is late, they will corner the funds for themselves. Therefore, am
seeking your co-operation to present you as the one to benefit from
his fund at his death, so that my bank headquarters will pay the funds
to you. I have done enough inside bank arrangement and you only have
to put in your details into the information network in the bank
computers and reflect you as his next of kin.

If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 40% of
the funds while 50% shall be for me while 10% will be for expenses
both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring of
the fund to your account. Kindly forward your response to me.


Best Regards
Dr. Benard Zoungrana
Managing Director (Head of Wealth and Investment Management)
