Hello,

I request the following patch from v4.10-rc1 to get cherry-picked into 
"stable/linux-4.9.y":

Debian had this old Bug 
<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=892105> reported 
against 4.9.82, which still exists in Debians old-stable 9 "Stretch" 
current kernel 4.9.258, but also with latest stable 4.9.273.


Our environment
===============
- KVM server
- dual port i40e
- classic bridge with enp96s0f0
- VM attached to bridge via veth
- no VLANs
- no MacVLan

> # ethtool -i enp96s0f0
> driver: i40e
> version: 1.6.16-k
> firmware-version: 3.33 0x80000e48 1.1876.0
> expansion-rom-version: 
> bus-info: 0000:60:00.0
> supports-statistics: yes
> supports-test: yes
> supports-eeprom-access: yes
> supports-register-dump: yes
> supports-priv-flags: ye

> # lspci -s 0000:60:00.0
> 60:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection X722 for 10GBASE-T (rev 09)


Analysis
========
As soon as we start one of our "Ubuntu" images the bridge stops 
receiving unicast packages for *all* VMs on that bridge.
- we still see outgoing traffic leaving the host, e.g. ARP requests
- "tcpdump -i enp96s0f0" shows no incoming unicast traffic, e.g. no ARP 
response
- broadcast traffic passes the bridge
- VMs on the same bridge can communicate with each other

Most often I see the following error message after doing `dmesg -n 8`:
> [  +9,376367] i40e 0000:60:00.0: cleared PE_CRITERR
> [  +0,000252] i40e 0000:60:00.0: TX driver issue detected, PF reset issued
> [  +0,859912] i40e 0000:60:00.0: Error I40E_AQ_RC_EINVAL adding RX filters on PF, promiscuous mode forced on

In one case I've seen this also (don't know if it is relevant):
> [  218.921466] i40e 0000:60:00.0 enp96s0f0: VSI_seid 390, Hung TX queue 43, tx_pending_hw: 1, NTC:0xa6, HWB: 0xa6, NTU: 0xa7, TAIL: 0xa7
> [  218.921470] i40e 0000:60:00.0 enp96s0f0: VSI_seid 390, Issuing force_wb for TX queue 43, Interrupt Reg: 0x0

After that error the only way to reset this broken state it to reboot 
the host. I've been unable to tear down the bridge and/or remove the 
`i40e` driver, which most often crashes the Linux kernel (some other bug 
on `ip link set enp96s0f0 nomaster`).

If you need more data I have a PCAP file, but I still don't know which 
packet exactly triggers the bug.


The bugs seems to be fixed with 4.10.0 and I bisected it down to

I used v4.10 as the basis and only bisected everything in 
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/ as vanilla v4.9 and several other 
versions between that and v4.10 crashed my host, so basically
   git checkout v4.10
   git checkout $hash -- drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/
   make all modules_install install
   git checkout v4-10 -- drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/
   git bisect (old|new) $hash

I verified that cherry-picking f114dca2533ca770aebebffb5ed56e5e7d1fb3fb 
on top of v4.9.273 fixes the problem and reverting it again shows the 
problem again.
