  My name is Alexei Navalny from Russia whom Vladimir Putin President of Russia the detects  is jailing me because I'm against his evil war plans against Ukraine. killing of Russia people  and the world in general. 

You can read more with below links:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/alexei-navalny-faces-10-more-years-prison-focus-ukraine-crisis-russia

 I will be happy to serve the 15 years in jail imposed by Putin but I need to assist Ukraine's displaced people around the world with the money I secretly deposited in one of the Turkish private  banks, now such money will be returned to Russian because d western world has blocked Russia . If you agreed to assist me 25% of the total sum will be for your assistance and the 75% will be used to assist the Ukraine displaced by Putin war.

If you agreed and are also willing to keep  this transaction confidential, I will send you all the details to approach the bank.

I contacted you because I need somebody out of Russia to do this job.

Please reply me here: aleshkanav@yandex.ru

Regards,
Alexei Navalny
