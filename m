Bah, there's stuff in-flight.

The cc_platform_has() was a small set:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/YX%2B5ekjTbK3rhX%2BY@zn.tnic

which wants to keep all those checks confidential guests are going to do
around the code, sane. So you don't really need it but...

... it will simplify all those backports which use it in the future. And
we will use cc_platform_has() from now on in common code.

In any case, we're going to backport it into SLE just for that reason -
so that it can ease backports and there's no kABI nightmares.
