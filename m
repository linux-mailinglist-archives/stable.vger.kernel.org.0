Subject: [PATCH] KVM: s390x: fix SCK locking

When handling the SCK instruction, the kvm lock is taken, even though
the vcpu lock is already being held. The normal locking order is kvm
lock first and then vcpu lock. This is can (and in some circumstances
does) lead to deadlocks.

The function kvm_s390_set_tod_clock is called both by the SCK handler
and by some IOCTLs to set the clock. The IOCTLs will not hold the vcpu
lock, so they can safely take the kvm lock. The SCK handler holds the
vcpu lock, but will also somehow need to acquire the kvm lock without
relinquishing the vcpu lock.

The solution is to factor out the code to set the clock, and provide
two wrappers. One is called like the original function and does the
locking, the other is called kvm_s390_try_set_tod_clock and uses
trylock to try to acquire the kvm lock. This new wrapper is then used
in the SCK handler. If locking fails, -EAGAIN is returned, which is
eventually propagated to userspace, thus also freeing the vcpu lock and
allowing for forward progress.

This is not the most efficient or elegant way to solve this issue, but
the SCK instruction is deprecated and its performance is not critical.

The goal of this patch is just to provide a simple but correct way to
fix the bug.
