[ Upstream commit cb0e52b7748737b2cf6481fdd9b920ce7e1ebbdf ]

We've noticed cases where tasks in a cgroup are stalled on memory but
there is little memory FULL pressure since tasks stay on the runqueue
in reclaim.

A simple example involves a single threaded program that keeps leaking
and touching large amounts of memory. It runs in a cgroup with swap
enabled, memory.high set at 10M and cpu.max ratio set at 5%. Though
there is significant CPU pressure and memory SOME, there is barely any
memory FULL since the task enters reclaim and stays on the runqueue.
However, this memory-bound task is effectively stalled on memory and
we expect memory FULL to match memory SOME in this scenario.

The code is confused about memstall && running, thinking there is a
stalled task and a productive task when there's only one task: a
reclaimer that's counted as both. To fix this, we redefine the
condition for PSI_MEM_FULL to check that all running tasks are in an
active memstall instead of checking that there are no running tasks.

        case PSI_MEM_FULL:
-               return unlikely(tasks[NR_MEMSTALL] && !tasks[NR_RUNNING]);
+               return unlikely(tasks[NR_MEMSTALL] &&
+                       tasks[NR_RUNNING] == tasks[NR_MEMSTALL_RUNNING]);

This will capture reclaimers. It will also capture tasks that called
psi_memstall_enter() and are about to sleep, but this should be
negligible noise.
