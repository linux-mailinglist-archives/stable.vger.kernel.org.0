commit 5ad7bbf3dba5c4a684338df1f285080f2588b535 upstream.

Currently amdgpu calls drm_sched_fini() from the fence driver sw fini
routine - such function is expected to be called only after the
respective init function - drm_sched_init() - was executed successfully.

Happens that we faced a driver probe failure in the Steam Deck
recently, and the function drm_sched_fini() was called even without
its counter-part had been previously called, causing the following oops:

amdgpu: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -110
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000090
PGD 0 P4D 0
Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI
CPU: 0 PID: 609 Comm: systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.2.0-rc3-gpiccoli #338
Hardware name: Valve Jupiter/Jupiter, BIOS F7A0113 11/04/2022
RIP: 0010:drm_sched_fini+0x84/0xa0 [gpu_sched]
[...]
Call Trace:
 <TASK>

 amdgpu_driver_release_kms+0x16/0x30 [amdgpu]
 devm_drm_dev_init_release+0x49/0x70
 [...]

To prevent that, check if the drm_sched was properly initialized for a
given ring before calling its fini counter-part.

Notice ideally we'd use sched.ready for that; such field is set as the latest
thing on drm_sched_init(). But amdgpu seems to "override" the meaning of such
field - in the above oops for example, it was a GFX ring causing the crash, and
the sched.ready field was set to true in the ring init routine, regardless of
the state of the DRM scheduler. Hence, we ended-up using sched.ops as per
Christian's suggestion [0], and also removed the no_scheduler check [1].
