commit 61114e734ccb804bc12561ab4020745e02c468c2 upstream.

After commit 49b290e430d3 ("riscv: prevent compressed instructions in
alternatives"), builds with LLVM's integrated assembler fail:

  In file included from ./include/linux/mm.h:29:

           ^
  <inline asm>:26:6: note: instantiated into assembly here
  .org    . - (889b - 888b) + (887b - 886b)
          ^

This error happens because LLVM's integrated assembler has a one-pass
design, which means it cannot figure out the instruction lengths when
the .org directive is outside of the subsection that contains the
instructions, which was changed by the .option directives added by the
above change.

Move the .org directives before the .previous directive so that these
directives are always within the same subsection, which resolves the
failures and does not introduce any new issues with GNU as. This was
done for arm64 in commit 966a0acce2fc ("arm64/alternatives: move length
validation inside the subsection") and commit 22315a2296f4 ("arm64:
alternatives: Move length validation in alternative_{insn, endif}").

While there is no error from the assembly versions of the macro, they
appear to have the same problem so just make the same change there as
well so that there are no problems in the future.
