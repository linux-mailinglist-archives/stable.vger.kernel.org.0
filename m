AFAIK, latest stable released openwrt uses ath9k from 4.19 tree and
AFAIK did not have above patch.

ath9k and ath10k wifi cards are widely used not only in wifi routers
(as access points) but also in laptops (as clients). These chips are
available on more (noname / laptop vendor branded) cards so are popular
also outside of openwrt market. Maybe people even do not know that their
wifi card in laptop has one of these Qualcomm chips.
