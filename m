I've tested by applying this patch. But the bug is still there. Just like
Peter has mentioned, we are using our in progress patches related to
pagemap_scan ioctl and userfaultd wp async patches to reproduce it.

To reproduce please build kernel and run pagemap_ioctl test in mm in
hugetlb_mem_reproducer branch:
https://gitlab.collabora.com/usama.anjum/linux-mainline/-/tree/hugetlb_mem_reproducer

In case you have any question on how to reproduce, please let me know. I'll
try to provide a cleaner alternative.
