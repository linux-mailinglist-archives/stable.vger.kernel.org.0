This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    iio: ltc2497: Fix reading conversion results

to my char-misc git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc.git
in the char-misc-testing branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will be merged to the char-misc-next branch sometime soon,
after it passes testing, and the merge window is open.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: iio: ltc2497: Fix reading conversion results
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

After the result of the previous conversion is read the chip
automatically starts a new conversion and doesn't accept new i2c
transfers until this conversion is completed which makes the function
return failure.

So add an early return iff the programming of the new address isn't
needed. Note this will not fix the problem in general, but all cases
that are currently used. Once this changes we get the failure back, but
this can be addressed when the need arises.
