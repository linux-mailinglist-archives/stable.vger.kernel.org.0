Dear  friend,

I know this means of communication may not be morally right to you as
a person but I also have had a great thought about it and I have come
to this conclusion which I am about to share with you.

INTRODUCTION: I am a banker   and in one way or the other was hoping
you will cooperate with me as a partner in a project of transferring
an abandoned fund of a late customer of the bank worth of $18,000,000
(Eighteen Million Dollars US).

This will be disbursed or shared between the both of us in these
percentages, 60% for me and 40% for you. Contact me immediately if
that is alright for you so that we can enter in agreement before we
start processing for the transfer of the funds. If you are satisfied
with this proposal, please provide the below details for the Mutual
Confidential Agreement:

1. Full Name and Address
2. Occupation and Country of Origin
3. Telephone Number

I wait for your response so that we can commence on this project as
soon as possible.

Regards,
Mr. Mussa  Ali
