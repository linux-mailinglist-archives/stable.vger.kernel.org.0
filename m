commit 406504c7b0405d74d74c15a667cd4c4620c3e7a9 upstream.

A recent development on the EFI front has resulted in guests having
their page tables baked in the firmware binary, and mapped into the
IPA space as part of a read-only memslot. Not only is this legitimate,
but it also results in added security, so thumbs up.

It is possible to take an S1PTW translation fault if the S1 PTs are
unmapped at stage-2. However, KVM unconditionally treats S1PTW as a
write to correctly handle hardware AF/DB updates to the S1 PTs.
Furthermore, KVM injects an exception into the guest for S1PTW writes.
In the aforementioned case this results in the guest taking an abort
it won't recover from, as the S1 PTs mapping the vectors suffer from
the same problem.

So clearly our handling is... wrong.

Instead, switch to a two-pronged approach:

- On S1PTW translation fault, handle the fault as a read

- On S1PTW permission fault, handle the fault as a write

This is of no consequence to SW that *writes* to its PTs (the write
will trigger a non-S1PTW fault), and SW that uses RO PTs will not
use HW-assisted AF/DB anyway, as that'd be wrong.

Only in the case described in c4ad98e4b72c ("KVM: arm64: Assume write
fault on S1PTW permission fault on instruction fetch") do we end-up
with two back-to-back faults (page being evicted and faulted back).
I don't think this is a case worth optimising for.
