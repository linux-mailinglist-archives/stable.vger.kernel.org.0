commit 2a9125317b247f2cf35c196f968906dcf062ae2d upstream.

Smatch reported that nents is not initialized and used in
stub_recv_cmd_submit(). nents is currently initialized by sgl_alloc()
and used to allocate multiple URBs when host controller doesn't
support scatter-gather DMA. The use of uninitialized nents means that
buf_len is zero and use_sg is true. But buffer length should not be
zero when an URB uses scatter-gather DMA.

To prevent this situation, add the conditional that checks buf_len
and use_sg. And move the use of nents right after the sgl_alloc() to
avoidÂ the use of uninitialized nents.

If the error occurs, it adds SDEV_EVENT_ERROR_MALLOC and stub_priv
will be released by stub event handler and connection will be shut
down.
