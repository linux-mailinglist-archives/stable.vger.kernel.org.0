MODERN MANUSCRIPT EDITING SERVICES
http://www.mmanuscripteditserv.com/index.htm


Do you want your manuscript TO BE written in standard English?
Do you want your journal articles, books, conference papers, and dissertations and theses to be substantially revised or edited?
Does your manuscript have to be in a particular journal format?
Then, MODERN MANUSCRIPT EDITING SERVICES is the right place for you.
So hurry up and get your papers edited in Standard English.

Dear Colleague,
Proofreading/Editing is a dynamic facet of publication, which we have taken into recognition; therefore, we call on writers/authors in all academic fields to submit their manuscripts for proofreading/editing. We have also observed that numerous articles are difficult to be understood by reviewers and editors due to poor grammatical usage, which is the consequence of the author learning English as a second language. Hence, we recommend that authors send us their manuscript(s) for accurate grammatical editing.

Send your manuscript(s) to articles@mmanuscripteditserv.com or mmanuscripteditserv@gmail.com for proofreading and grammatical correction. The manuscript must be in Arial font, font size 12 and double line spacing. Upon receipt of the manuscript, an acknowledgment letter containing the manuscript number and the handling fee will be sent to the author(s).

Our charges are as follows: $25 per 1000 words, meaning

Number of Words	Price
1 to 1,000    	$25
1,001 to 2,000	$50
2,001 to 3,000	$75
3,001 to 4,000	$100
4,001 to 5,000	$125
5,001 to 6,000	$150
6,001 to 7,000	$175

Payments are made via online using credit card, PayPal or bank wire transfer. In addition, we specialize in proofreading, grammar editing, proper punctuation, paraphrasing and sentence editing, aligning articles to the required format and translating from your native language to English.

For more information, please visit our website http://www.mmanuscripteditserv.com. We would appreciate it if you could share this information with your colleagues and associates. 

Best regards,
