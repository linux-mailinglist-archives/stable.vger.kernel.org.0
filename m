Ugh, yes you are right, my apologies.

The reason is that v5.3 converted spi-bcm2835.c to use the
"spi_controller" nomenclature instead of "spi_master" with
commit 5f336ea53b6b ("spi: bcm2835: Replace spi_master by
spi_controller").

The replacement patch below should hopefully not break the
build.  It's the same as upstream commit 8d8bef503658,
except one occurrence of "ctlr" is replaced by "master".

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] spi: bcm2835: Fix 3-wire mode if DMA is enabled
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Commit 6935224da248 ("spi: bcm2835: enable support of 3-wire mode")
added 3-wire support to the BCM2835 SPI driver by setting the REN bit
(Read Enable) in the CS register when receiving data.  The REN bit puts
the transmitter in high-impedance state.  The driver recognizes that
data is to be received by checking whether the rx_buf of a transfer is
non-NULL.

Commit 3ecd37edaa2a ("spi: bcm2835: enable dma modes for transfers
meeting certain conditions") subsequently broke 3-wire support because
it set the SPI_MASTER_MUST_RX flag which causes spi_map_msg() to replace
rx_buf with a dummy buffer if it is NULL.  As a result, rx_buf is
*always* non-NULL if DMA is enabled.

Reinstate 3-wire support by not only checking whether rx_buf is non-NULL,
but also checking that it is not the dummy buffer.

Fixes: 3ecd37edaa2a ("spi: bcm2835: enable dma modes for transfers meeting certain conditions")
