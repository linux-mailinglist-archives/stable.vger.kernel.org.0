I=E2=80=99m Mr. Mathieu a banker working with a commercial bank as a Chief
Financial Officer. I have a business deal for our mutual benefit. One
of our customers died few years ago without any registered next-of-kin
in his bio-data/account file which is peculiar with high profile
investors. I think he was your relative because you both share the
same family's name. Right now my bank wants to sit on this money (US$
13 .5 Million) as unclaimed and abandoned funds which I do not want
because of reasons I will explain to you when I receive your response.
Please get back to me as fast as you can with your mobile telephone
number for more details on how the funds can be turned into yours by
right of inheritance for us to claim and share equally afterwards;
Best Regards, I am urgently expecting your reply.

Yours,
Mr. Mathieu
