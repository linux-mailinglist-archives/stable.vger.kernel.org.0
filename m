Hi,

in some cases we are running multiple recipes in a single test job, to
get out the results faster. Each recipe is started by a "boot test" since
that's responsible for installing and booting the kernel being tested. The
report joins all recipes for given architecture, hence that one test is
shown there multiple times. I agree that we should make this more clear
and separate the report parts per recipes but we didn't have time for it
yet, sorry. I notified people about the problem and we'll prioritize :)

Here you can find the list of subtests that's being run [0] and a list of
excluded ones from them [1]. This is just a reduced test set as some of the
tests were triggering fake failures or taking too long to run as a part of
CI. The lists may change in the future of course.

We set up two separate xfs partitions for the testing. The machine should
have at least 50G of space available for this.


Hope this explains everything and sorry for the recipe confusion. Let us
know if you have anything else!
