It's not about file conflicts but the compilation fails after the
patch.
sound/firewire/amdtp-am824.c: In function ‘read_midi_messages’:
sound/firewire/amdtp-am824.c:324:16: error: ‘struct amdtp_stream’ has no member named ‘ctx_data’
   port = (8 - s->ctx_data.tx.first_dbc + s->data_block_counter + f) % 8;
                ^~
