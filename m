commit 4203e968947071586a98b5314fd7ffdea3b4f971 upstream.

We've historically had reports of being unable to mount file systems
because the tree log root couldn't be read.  Usually this is the "parent
transid failure", but could be any of the related errors, including
"fsid mismatch" or "bad tree block", depending on which block got
allocated.

The modification of the individual log root items are serialized on the
per-log root root_mutex.  This means that any modification to the
per-subvol log root_item is completely protected.

However we update the root item in the log root tree outside of the log
root tree log_mutex.  We do this in order to allow multiple subvolumes
to be updated in each log transaction.

This is problematic however because when we are writing the log root
tree out we update the super block with the _current_ log root node
information.  Since these two operations happen independently of each
other, you can end up updating the log root tree in between writing out
the dirty blocks and setting the super block to point at the current
root.

This means we'll point at the new root node that hasn't been written
out, instead of the one we should be pointing at.  Thus whatever garbage
or old block we end up pointing at complains when we mount the file
system later and try to replay the log.

Fix this by copying the log's root item into a local root item copy.
Then once we're safely under the log_root_tree->log_mutex we update the
root item in the log_root_tree.  This way we do not modify the
log_root_tree while we're committing it, fixing the problem.
