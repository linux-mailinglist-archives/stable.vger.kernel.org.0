[ Upstream commit bcdb6fd4f3e9ac1097698c8d8f56b70853b49873 ]

Slot capabilities are currently not reported because emulated bridge does
not report the PCI_EXP_FLAGS_SLOT flag.

Set PCI_EXP_FLAGS_SLOT to let the kernel know that PCI_EXP_SLT* registers
are supported.

Move setting of PCI_EXP_SLTCTL register from "dynamic" pcie_conf_read
function to static buffer as it is only statically filled the
PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_PDS flag and dynamic read callback is not needed for this
register.

Set Presence State Bit to 1 since there is no support for unplugging the
card and there is currently no platform able to detect presence of a card -
in such a case the bit needs to be set to 1.

Finally correctly set Physical Slot Number to 1 since there is only one
port and zero value is reserved for ports within the same silicon as Root
Port which is not our case for Aardvark HW.
