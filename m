I need some clarification here. It sounds like memoryless nodes work on
x86, but hotplug + memoryless nodes isn't a supported use case or you're
introducing it as a new use case?

If this is a new use case, then I'm inclined to say this patch should
NOT go in and a proper fix should be implemented on hotplug's side. I
don't want to be in the business of having/seeing this conversation
reoccur because we just papered over this issue in percpu.

Thanks,
Dennis
