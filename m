[ Upstream commit aab5e3ea95b958cf22a24e756a84e635bdb081c1 ]

imx50-evk has duplicate memory nodes:

- One coming from the board dts file: memory@

- One coming from the imx50.dtsi file.

Fix the duplication by removing the memory node from the dtsi file
and by adding 'device_type = "memory";' in the board dts.
