Yes, pgdat is quite large! Just embeded zones can eat a lot.

This is what pahole tells me
struct pglist_data {
        struct zone                node_zones[4] __attribute__((__aligned__(64))); /*     0  5632 */
        /* --- cacheline 88 boundary (5632 bytes) --- */
        struct zonelist            node_zonelists[1];    /*  5632    80 */
	[...]
        /* size: 6400, cachelines: 100, members: 27 */
        /* sum members: 6369, holes: 5, sum holes: 31 */

with my particular config (which is !NUMA). I haven't really checked
whether there are other places which might scale with MAX_NUM_NODES or
something like that.

Anyway, is 21MB of wasted space for 128 Node machine something really
note worthy?
