Any objection for this to be picked up by stable? We care about Patch 1 only in
this series for stable, but it seems sensible to pick this one too, no strong
feeling if it is omitted though.

AFAICT it seems the problem dates back since commit:

	1593baab910d ("sched/debug: Implement consistent task-state printing")

or even before. I think v4.14+ is good enough.

Thoughts?

Thanks!
