Hello,

We ran automated tests on a patchset that was proposed for merging into this
kernel tree. The patches were applied to:

       Kernel repo: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
            Commit: 140839fe4e71 - Linux 5.2.12

The results of these automated tests are provided below.

    Overall result: PASSED
             Merge: OK
           Compile: OK
             Tests: OK

All kernel binaries, config files, and logs are available for download here:

  https://artifacts.cki-project.org/pipelines/147783

Please reply to this email if you have any questions about the tests that we
ran or if you have any suggestions on how to make future tests more effective.

Merge testing
-------------

We cloned this repository and checked out the following commit:

  Repo: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
  Commit: 140839fe4e71 - Linux 5.2.12


We grabbed the 086f4245e484 commit of the stable queue repository.

We then merged the patchset with `git am`:

  revert-input-elantech-enable-smbus-on-new-2018-systems.patch

Compile testing
---------------

We compiled the kernel for 3 architectures:

    aarch64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 targz-pkg

    ppc64le:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 targz-pkg

    x86_64:
      make options: -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 targz-pkg


Hardware testing
----------------
We booted each kernel and ran the following tests:

Waived tests
------------
If the test run included waived tests, they are marked with ðŸš§. Such tests are
executed but their results are not taken into account. Tests are waived when
their results are not reliable enough, e.g. when they're just introduced or are
being fixed.
