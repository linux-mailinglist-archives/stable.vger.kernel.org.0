Yeah, no replies received on my end I'm afraid.

Modifying the code does not strictly means something is a fix for a 
certain patch.

Umesh commented that patch 2 is not needed - who is right then? :)

Yes that is clear, what is needed is the split of the for_each_engine 
loop into request and wait.

But question is how much backporting trouble will the _extra_ changes 
patch 1 brings create.

In the ideal world patch 1 wouldn't be an optimising one, I mean adding 
skipping of TLB invalidations on idle engines but just the loop split. 
That would make it smaller and more suitable for Cc: stable. Because 
both i915_gem_pages.c and intel_gt_pm.h hunks wouldn't even be there. 
And the refactor in intel_gt_invalidate_tlbs would be smaller since it 
wouldn't be adding the engine awake checks...

... which for me means a different patch 1, followed by patch 6 (moved 
to be patch 2) would be ideal stable material.

Then we have the current patch 2 which is open/unknown (to me at least).

And the rest seem like optimisations which shouldn't be tagged as fixes.

Apart from patch 5 which should be cc: stable, but no fixes as agreed.

Could you please double check if what I am suggesting here is feasible 
to implement and if it is just send those minimal patches out alone?

Maybe it even makes sense to squash such 1&2 into a single patch.

Again, since the original TLB flush was backported quite far back into 
long term stable releases I think it would be much easier to really have 
a minimal patch/series to fix Broadwell in those kernels.
