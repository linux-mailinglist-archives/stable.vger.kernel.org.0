commit f4329d1f848ac35757d9cc5487669d19dfc5979c upstream.

Scenario:
---------

bio chain generated by blk_queue_split().
Some split bio fails and propagates its error status to the "parent" bio.
But then the (last part of the) parent bio itself completes without error.

We would clobber the already recorded error status with BLK_STS_OK,
causing silent data corruption.

Reproducer:
-----------

How to trigger this in the real world within seconds:

DRBD on top of degraded parity raid,
small stripe_cache_size, large read_ahead setting.
Drop page cache (sysctl vm.drop_caches=1, fadvise "DONTNEED",
umount and mount again, "reboot").

Cause significant read ahead.

Large read ahead request is split by blk_queue_split().
Parts of the read ahead that are already in the stripe cache,
or find an available stripe cache to use, can be serviced.
Parts of the read ahead that would need "too much work",
would need to wait for a "stripe_head" to become available,
are rejected immediately.

For larger read ahead requests that are split in many pieces, it is very
likely that some "splits" will be serviced, but then the stripe cache is
exhausted/busy, and the remaining ones will be rejected.
