3.16.82-rc1 review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: SeongJae Park <sjpark@amazon.de>

commit f9bd84a8a845d82f9b5a081a7ae68c98a11d2e84 upstream.

For each I/O request, blkback first maps the foreign pages for the
request to its local pages.  If an allocation of a local page for the
mapping fails, it should unmap every mapping already made for the
request.

However, blkback's handling mechanism for the allocation failure does
not mark the remaining foreign pages as unmapped.  Therefore, the unmap
function merely tries to unmap every valid grant page for the request,
including the pages not mapped due to the allocation failure.  On a
system that fails the allocation frequently, this problem leads to
following kernel crash.

This commit fixes this problem by marking the grant pages of the given
request that didn't mapped due to the allocation failure as invalid.
