Greetings My Dear,

    I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in
which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see
the next day. I am Mrs. Francisca  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late
Mr John Carlsen, a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some
funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of (eleven million
dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which
is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having
known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good person
that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a
very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it
for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools for
less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible
and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is
maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death,
so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not
have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want
your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to
execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your
reply.

May God Bless you,
Mrs. Francisca Carlsen
