[ Upstream commit 509c583620e9053e43d611bf1614fc3d3abafa96 ]

The original driver by default defines num_chipselects as -1.
This actually allicates an array of 65535 entries in
of_spi_register_master.

There is a side-effect for buggy device trees that (contrary to
dt-binding documentation) have no cs-gpio defined.

This mode was never supported by the driver due to limitations
of native cs and additional code complexity and is explicitly
not stated to be implemented.

To keep backwards compatibility with such buggy DTs we limit
the number of chip_selects to 1, as for all practical purposes
it is only ever realistic to use a single chip select in
native cs mode without negative side-effects.
