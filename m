[ Upstream commit 0919e1b69ab459e06df45d3ba6658d281962db80 ]

When a huge page is allocated, PagePrivate() is set if the allocation
consumed a reservation.  When freeing a huge page, PagePrivate is checked.
If set, it indicates the reservation should be restored.  PagePrivate
being set at free huge page time mostly happens on error paths.

When huge page reservations are created, a check is made to determine if
the mapping is associated with an explicitly mounted filesystem.  If so,
pages are also reserved within the filesystem.  The default action when
freeing a huge page is to decrement the usage count in any associated
explicitly mounted filesystem.  However, if the reservation is to be
restored the reservation/use count within the filesystem should not be
decrementd.  Otherwise, a subsequent page allocation and free for the same
mapping location will cause the file filesystem usage to go 'negative'.

Filesystem                         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
nodev                              4.0G -4.0M  4.1G    - /opt/hugepool

To fix, when freeing a huge page do not adjust filesystem usage if
PagePrivate() is set to indicate the reservation should be restored.

I did not cc stable as the problem has been around since reserves were
added to hugetlbfs and nobody has noticed.
