This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    usb: f_ncm: only first packet of aggregate needs to start timer

to my usb git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git
in the usb-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

The reasoning for this change is that if we already had
a packet pending, then we also already had a pending timer,
and as such there is no need to reschedule it.

This also prevents packets getting delayed 60 ms worst case
under a tiny packet every 290us transmit load, by keeping the
timeout always relative to the first queued up packet.
(300us delay * 16KB max aggregation / 80 byte packet =~ 60 ms)

As such the first packet is now at most delayed by 300us.

Under low transmit load, this will simply result in us sending
a shorter aggregate, as originally intended.

This patch has the benefit of greatly reducing (by ~10 factor
with 1500 byte frames aggregated into 16 kiB) the number of
(potentially pretty costly) updates to the hrtimer.
