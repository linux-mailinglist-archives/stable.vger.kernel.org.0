Yea, of course, this is something needed to investigate.

Anyway, do you see driver crashes? Or just these AER errors? And are
your PCIe cards working, or after seeing these messages in dmesg they
stopped working? It is needed to know if you are just spammed by tons of
lines in dmesg and otherwise everything works. Or if after AER errors
your PCIe devices stop working and rebooting system is required.

> Also, any idea what this error in my logs is actually indicating?

Your PCIe controller received non-fatal, but uncorrected error. There is
also indication of Unsupported Request Completion Status. Unsupported
Request is generated by PCIe device when controller / host / kernel try
to do something which is not supported by device; pretty generic error.
PCIe base spec describe lot of scenarios when card should return this
error. Maybe some more detailed information are in TLP Header hexdump,
but I cannot decode it now.

Basically it is PCIe card driver who could know how fatal it is that
issue and how to recover from it. But as you can see intel wifi driver
does not implement that callback.
