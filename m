Thx for highlighting it and CCing me.

Quick question: how fast do you think this should head towards mainline?

The patch landed in next today, so that step in the process is already
covered. But is the issue serious enough to say "send this to Linus
after it was a day or two in next, so it can be quickly backported to
stable"?

In that case let me just briefly drop a link to the regression, as
regzbot will notice that and file is as an activity.

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20221216163227.24648-1-vbabka@suse.cz/

And simply consider your patch submission as a new report I track
separately:

#regzbot introduced ca3d76b0aa80 ^
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1206359#c35
#regzbot title mm, mremap: another issue with mremap not fully fixed
with the previous fix for the regression
#regzbot fix: mm, mremap: fix mremap() expanding for vma's with
vm_ops->close()
#regzbot ignore-activity

Not ideal, but that will make sure it's on regzbot radar (where way too
many dots appear currently, as I'm a bit behind with things... :-/ )

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
