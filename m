So why don't we just revert 530436c45ef2 ("nvme: Discard workaround for
non-conformant devices") from the stable trees?  Will that fix the issue
for you instead of the much-larger set of backports you are proposing?

Also, is this an issue for you in the 4.19 releases?  The above
mentioned patch showed up in 4.19.92 and 5.4.7.

I still don't understand what the patch here is, as you don't really
provide any information about it in a format I am used to seeing.  Can
you redo it in the documented style of submitting a normal patch to the
kernel tree so that might help explain things?
