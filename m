Dear ALLAH Elect,

It's my pleasure to have contact with you, based on the critical
condition I find mine self, though, it's not financial problem, but my
health, you might have know that cancer is not what to talk home
about, though I don't know you, and my contact with you  was not by
mistake, but by devine favour of  ALLAH.

I am married to Mr. Mohammed  Ibrahim who worked with Tunisia embassy
in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2008.We were
married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for five days.

Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of US$ 2.2m(two million two hundred
thousand dollars)in a bank in Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina
Faso in west Africa Presently this money is still in bank. He made
this money available for exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining.
Recently, My Doctor told me that I don't have much time to live
because of the cancer problem,

Please Reply to this Email Id:( mrs2018sabahibrahim@gmail.com)

 Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this money to
take care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money
the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take 30 Percent
of the total money for your personal use While 70% of the money will
go to charity" people and helping the orphanage.


 I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I
grew up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member,
just to endeavor that the name of ALLAH  is maintained. Am doing this
so that ALLAH  will forgive my sins and accept my soul because this
sickness has suffered me so much.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
bank in Burkina Faso and I will send authority letter that will prove
you the present beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you
assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to
receive your reply. Reply in my alternative email address
(mrs2018sabahibrahim@gmail.com) for confidential

Regards,
Mrs. Sabah  Ibrahim
