Actually if we want to check the group and there are only 2 interfaces we do
not need to use the match callback at all, w e can simply match on the
group of the interface which we do want:

Much cleaner (and now I don't need to write a test, which is always
a good motivation to come up with a cleaner solution :)

Let me turn this into a proper patch and then I will send that to
ZdenÄ›k (off-list) for him to test (note don't worry if you do
not have time to test this weekend, then I'll do it on Monday).

Regards,

Hans

p.s.

1. My train is approaching Brussels (Fosdem) so my email response
time will soon become irregular.

2. Benjamin will you be at Fosdem too ?
