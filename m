Can you share the ACPI tables and point me to the GPIO that is using
Linux number?

This is something that should be fixed in userspace. Using global Linux
GPIO or IRQ numbers is fragile and source of issues like this. There are
correct ways of using GPIOs from userspace: in case of sysfs, you can
find the base of the chip and then user relative numbering against it or
switch to use libgpiod that does the same but uses the newer char
device. Both cases the GPIO number are relative against the GPIO chip so
they work even if global Linux GPIO numbering changes.
