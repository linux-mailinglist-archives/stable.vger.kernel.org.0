Thanks for the suggestion Sasha, it'd certainly be easier for us and
distros/end-users if such renames/repartition patches could land in -stable.

We have e.g. another recent case we de-duplicated a set of
jack-detection enums in "ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: include rt711.h for RT711
JD mode" and as a result the addition of newer quirks for Dell or NUC
devices won't apply cleanly on the stable branch.
