[ Upstream commit 0125acda7d76b943ca55811df40ed6ec0ecf670f ]

Currently, x86_spec_ctrl_base is read at boot time and speculative bits
are set if Kconfig items are enabled. For example, IBRS is enabled if
CONFIG_CPU_IBRS_ENTRY is configured, etc. These MSR bits are not cleared
if the mitigations are disabled.

This is a problem when kexec-ing a kernel that has the mitigation
disabled from a kernel that has the mitigation enabled. In this case,
the MSR bits are not cleared during the new kernel boot. As a result,
this might have some performance degradation that is hard to pinpoint.

This problem does not happen if the machine is (hard) rebooted because
the bit will be cleared by default.
