More common doesn't mean less annoying. If you're in the middle of
plenty of impolite and annoying people, you might feel very uneasy
and that doesn't necessarily make you wrong. Top posting is
irrespectful of the time of those who have to read you and respond
to you and you're really lucky to find people accepting to respond
to such painful messages.
