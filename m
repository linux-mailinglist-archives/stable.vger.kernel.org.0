This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    iio: buffer: Fix demux update

to my staging git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git
in the staging-next branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will also be merged in the next major kernel release
during the merge window.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: iio: buffer: Fix demux update
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When updating the buffer demux, we will skip a scan element from the
device in the case `in_ind != out_ind` and we enter the while loop.
in_ind should only be refreshed with `find_next_bit()` in the end of the
loop.

Note, to cause problems we need a situation where we are skippig over
an element (channel not enabled) that happens to not have the same size
as the next element.   Whilst this is a possible situation we haven't
actually identified any cases in mainline where it happens as most drivers
have consistent channel storage sizes with the exception of the timestamp
which is the last element and hence never skipped over.
