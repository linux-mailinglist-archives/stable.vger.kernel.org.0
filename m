I doubt that ASMedia publish something...

But has somebody contact to ASMedia? I can try it.

Basically these ASMedia SATA controller chips are present on more
"noname" mPCIe-form cards and I guess ASMedia is not going to support
them.

Note that we have also tested Marvell PCIe-based SATA controllers which
support MPS of 512 bytes too and there were no problem with them on
A3720 nor CN9130.
