Scratch that, this is breaks the setting of CNTVOFF, which gets
populated when we create the vcpu. The gotcha is that creating a vcpu
resets CNTVOFF for *all* vcpus:

* If the VMM creates all vcpus, then reset them all, this works
  "fine": all the vcpus have CNTVOFF==0, which is an acceptable
  departure from the current behaviour (where vtime starts at 0).

* If the VMM alternates vcpu creation and reset, then the last vcpu
  ends up with a CNTVOFF set to 0, while all the others have a
  different offset.

QEMU does the former, and kvmtool the latter. Thanks to Will for the
heads up. I'll drop the patch from -next and post a v2 shortly.

Thanks,

	M.
