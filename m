[ Upstream commit ac854131d9844f79e2fdcef67a7707227538d78a ]

The syzbot fuzzer found a race between URB submission to endpoint 0
and device reset.  Namely, during the reset we call usb_ep0_reinit()
because the characteristics of ep0 may have changed (if the reset
follows a firmware update, for example).  While usb_ep0_reinit() is
running there is a brief period during which the pointers stored in
udev->ep_in[0] and udev->ep_out[0] are set to NULL, and if an URB is
submitted to ep0 during that period, usb_urb_ep_type_check() will
report it as a driver bug.  In the absence of those pointers, the
routine thinks that the endpoint doesn't exist.  The log message looks
like this:

------------[ cut here ]------------
usb 2-1: BOGUS urb xfer, pipe 2 != type 2
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9241 at drivers/usb/core/urb.c:478
usb_submit_urb+0x1188/0x1460 drivers/usb/core/urb.c:478

Now, although submitting an URB while the device is being reset is a
questionable thing to do, it shouldn't count as a driver bug as severe
as submitting an URB for an endpoint that doesn't exist.  Indeed,
endpoint 0 always exists, even while the device is in its unconfigured
state.

To prevent these misleading driver bug reports, this patch updates
usb_disable_endpoint() to avoid clearing the ep_in[] and ep_out[]
pointers when the endpoint being disabled is ep0.  There's no danger
of leaving a stale pointer in place, because the usb_host_endpoint
structure being pointed to is stored permanently in udev->ep0; it
doesn't get deallocated until the entire usb_device structure does.
