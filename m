Yeah, I'm aware of it. But it seems...

...that approach is not making any progress either?

Jan, can could provide a short status update here? I'd really like to
get this regression fixed one way or another rather sooner than later,
as this is taken way to long already IMHO.

Sure.

BTW, as you seem to be familiar with the issue: there is another report
about a regression WRT to Xen and i915 (that is also not making really
progress):
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yn%2FTgj1Ehs%2FBdpHp@itl-email/

It's just a wild guess, but bould this somehow be related?
