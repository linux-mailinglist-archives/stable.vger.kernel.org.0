Hello my dear!!

Sorry for my late reply due to we have been busy in conclusion of the transaction it is my pleasure to reach you after our unsuccessful attempt on our business transaction. Well, I just want to use this medium to say thank you very much for your earlier assistance to help me in receiving the fund, I am obliged to inform you that I have succeeded in transferring those fund through the help of a new partner from Vietnam everything was perfectly done because we stroke a deal with one of the Lady accountant who works with the Federal Ministry of Finance (F M F), and she rendered tremendous help to us. My new partner initiated this idea and it worked out successfully.

In appreciation of your earlier assistance to me in receiving the funds, I have decided to compensate you with the sum $700 000 00 USD  please accept it as a token of appreciation from Me. Presently; I am in Vietnam for investment project and treatment of my health. Since it was difficult to contact you before I traveled due to the urgency of my health status, I have left instruction with my personal secretary in Ghana Ms. Rita Benson, Please contact her through her E-mail address. (ritabens1@yahoo.com) for sending you this compensation I left on under her care for you.

Please email my secretary Ms. Rita Benson on her e-mail (ritabens1@yahoo.com) and inform her that I have contacted you that she should go ahead release your money $700 000 00 USD  to you so feel free to get in touch with her.

God Bless you and your family.
Yours Sincerely,
From Mr. Simon Dornoo
