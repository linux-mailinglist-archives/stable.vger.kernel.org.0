I'd say it's fine if it's your own program that you can in full control
easily. :) Sorry again for not noticing that earlier.

There's one reason that we may consider keeping the behavior.  IMHO it is
when there're major softwares that uses the "wrong" ABI (let's say so;
because it's not following the man pages).  If you're aware any such major
softwares (especially open sourced) will break due to this revert patch,
please shoot.

So far it looks still fine if with this revert.  Maybe I overlooked
somewhere?

I'll add this into my todo, but with low priority.  If you have suggestion
already on how to improve the man page please do so before me!
