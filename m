Hello,

I am Martin Henry, An American Citizen; I am the personal secretary to
Mr. Donald Railton, the controller of a Lottery Company. Please I am
having big problem now, I have a 6yrs old daughter who has leukemia, a
disease of the blood, and she needs a bone marrow transplant or she
will die.

Please I am only asking for your help and you will benefit from it
also. As an insider with Lottery Firm, working as the personal
secretary to the controller, I want you to send me your name to play,
I have some numbers that are going to win, stored in his secret data
system in the office. The Lottery is an online entry with credit card
anywhere with a name and address. All I want you to do is to send your
name to play it and I will send confirmation to you.

I will play with my card on your name and the Prize will be shared
equally between us. Immediately the results are released they will
contact you for payment as the oversea winner. The lotto can be played
with 9.00 dollars, or 50 dollars but the prize will be Millions.
Remember that I am playing on your name with my card; I just want to
front you for this, because I need this money to save the life of my
little daughter.

Thanks and I wait for your answer
Martin Henry.
