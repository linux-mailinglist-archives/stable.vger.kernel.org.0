Dear friend,

Please do accept my apologies I do not wish to invade into your
privacy. I am Clement Kwasi, a banker. I was the account manager to a
customer of our bank; he deposited $25M US dollars in our bank before
his untimely death occurred. He was an oil merchant. Now the
management of our bank ordered me as the account manager to the
deceased person to present to them, the next of kin/beneficiary since
he is late.

I have made several unsuccessful attempts to find his relation
although the deceased person did not write any names as the next of
kin/beneficiary. Please I want to present you to the bank as the next
of kin to the deceased person. I will back you up with some questions
and information the bank may ask or know from you as the next of
kin/beneficiary to the LATE CLIENT.

I want this money to be transferred to any offshore account of your
choice before the management of our bank will confiscate the money due
to it having been dormant as the account has not been servicing for a
long time. I am contacting you with good intention for our mutual
benefit. Please get back to me for more details on how the transaction
will be carried out and on the percentage we will share the money when
the transfer is done.  Here is my email Kindly get back to me ;
kwaclement01@gmail.com

My regards,
Clement Kwasi.
