commit 20aac6c60981f5bfacd66661d090d907bf1482f0 upstream.

Validate mount_lock seqcount as soon as we cross into mount in RCU
mode.  Sure, ->mnt_root is pinned and will remain so until we
do rcu_read_unlock() anyway, and we will eventually fail to unlazy if
the mount_lock had been touched, but we might run into a hard error
(e.g. -ENOENT) before trying to unlazy.  And it's possible to end
up with RCU pathwalk racing with rename() and umount() in a way
that would fail with -ENOENT while non-RCU pathwalk would've
succeeded with any timings.

Once upon a time we hadn't needed that, but analysis had been subtle,
brittle and went out of window as soon as RENAME_EXCHANGE had been
added.

It's narrow, hard to hit and won't get you anything other than
stray -ENOENT that could be arranged in much easier way with the
same priveleges, but it's a bug all the same.
