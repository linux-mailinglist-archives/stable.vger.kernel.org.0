Hello My Dear,
Please accept my Confession and remember if i don't, you have already lose =
it !

I am The-lotto Australia prize claim agent, at the time past an
official e-mail prize win-notification letter was sent to your e-mail
from The-lotto board saying that your email has won a prize, it=E2=80=99s t=
rue
but you ignored it, maybe you thought is unofficial, your email won
the sum of 1.750.000.00US$ bonus from Horse raise that paid the real
winner 10.5Million US$ competition held in BF West Africa.

During the raise, e-mails was randomly selected to attach to each
winners 1,2,3, to receive their prize bonus to promote e-mail
companies /users your e-mail came out with first .

Normally ; you suppose to file for your claims but after long waiting,
I noticed that you are not forthcoming I forged a document through the
name of your e-mail account and contacted someone who stand and claim
the prize successfully as you, but my conscience didn=E2=80=99t allow me se=
at
on the total money, so i request NatWest paying Bank to put the amount
of 750.000.00US$ cash into a box and deliver to you through (UN) Agent
that distributes covid-19 vaccine worldwide as family treasure not as
money because if they know is money, they will refuse said by the
bank, they ask if there is any School (or) Hospital close to your
location where they can deliver this box to you in your country.

They request for your name =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=
=80=A6

ID Number=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6+
