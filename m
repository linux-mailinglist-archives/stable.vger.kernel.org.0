My main concern is not that AER messages started showing up, but that there
started being kernel NPE and WARNINGS showing up sometime after 5.19.0.

Possibly this AER thing is mis-direction and the real bug is elsewhere,
but since the bugzilla also indicated (different) driver crashes, then
I am suspicious this changes things more significantly, at least in a subset
of hardware out there.

Also, any idea what this error in my logs is actually indicating?

Thanks,
Ben
