3.16.80-rc1 review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Kai-Heng Feng <kai.heng.feng@canonical.com>

commit fc5db58539b49351e76f19817ed1102bf7c712d0 upstream.

Some Coffee Lake platforms have a skewed HPET timer once the SoCs entered
PC10, which in consequence marks TSC as unstable because HPET is used as
watchdog clocksource for TSC.

Harry Pan tried to work around it in the clocksource watchdog code [1]
thereby creating a circular dependency between HPET and TSC. This also
ignores the fact, that HPET is not only unsuitable as watchdog clocksource
on these systems, it becomes unusable in general.

Disable HPET on affected platforms.
