Well, I'm aware of all that, but OTOH I might be missing something, as
your reply makes me wonder: what is stopping you from asking Dave/Jakub
or even Linus himself to directly pick up a regression fix that
obviously bothers multiple people (the handful we known about might be
the tip of the iceberg)? Some mailing list posts from Linus iirc
indicate something like that is not a big problem for him, if it doesn't
happen too often. With such a approach the issue could have vanished a
from all our versions a week earlier (if that worth it in this
particular case is a different question; same for skipping linux-next,
but you accepted the patch on a Thursday, so it could have been in there
for one regular work day). Or would that also skip some wireless
specific CI that you want to chew on the patch first?

The thing is: I noticed how quickly regressions sometimes get fixed when
Linus is directly involved somehow, especially in cases where he himself
is affected by the issue. Obviously he deserves some special treatment,
but OTOH it kinda feels wrong to me when other regression fixes hang
around in git tree for weeks before they finally make it to mainline
(which is needed to also get them fixed in stable trees).

But okay, let's assume for a moment that things can't be sped up, to
bring me back to the question that made me write the mail you replied
to: Should I (or you/Johannes?) in that case have asked Greg to
temporarily revert the culprit in the stable tree until the fix is ready?

Ciao, Thorsten
