commit f9619d5e5174867536b7e558683bc4408eab833f upstream.

Depending on the number of online CPUs in the original kernel, it is
likely for CPU #0 to be offline in a kdump kernel. The associated IRQs
in the affinity mappings provided by irq_create_affinity_masks() are
thus not started by irq_startup(), as per-design with managed IRQs.

This can be a problem with multi-queue block devices driven by blk-mq :
such a non-started IRQ is very likely paired with the single queue
enforced by blk-mq during kdump (see blk_mq_alloc_tag_set()). This
causes the device to remain silent and likely hangs the guest at
some point.

This is a regression caused by commit 9ea69a55b3b9 ("powerpc/pseries:
Pass MSI affinity to irq_create_mapping()"). Note that this only happens
with the XIVE interrupt controller because XICS has a workaround to bypass
affinity, which is activated during kdump with the "noirqdistrib" kernel
parameter.

The issue comes from a combination of factors:
- discrepancy between the number of queues detected by the multi-queue
  block driver, that was used to create the MSI vectors, and the single
  queue mode enforced later on by blk-mq because of kdump (i.e. keeping
  all queues fixes the issue)
- CPU#0 offline (i.e. kdump always succeed with CPU#0)

Given that I couldn't reproduce on x86, which seems to always have CPU#0
online even during kdump, I'm not sure where this should be fixed. Hence
going for another approach : fine-grained affinity is for performance
and we don't really care about that during kdump. Simply revert to the
previous working behavior of ignoring affinity masks in this case only.
