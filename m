Most of the ioctls you listed are not write-exclusive because existing
user space applications (such as mtd-utils) issue them on a read-only fd.
So, we didn't want to break them.
Before we move such an ioctl to the "non-safe" list, common user space needs to
be inspected. This includes, android, openwrt, mtd-utils, etc...

On the other hand, this is a raw mtd, it is hard to draw the line.
For NAND even reading allows an attacker doing harm, she can trigger read-distrurb
super efficiently using the read ioctl...

So passing an mtdchar fd (no matter whether read or write mode) to untrusted
entities is a bad idea.

Thanks,
