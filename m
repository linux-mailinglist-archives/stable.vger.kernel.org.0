From: Josh Poimboeuf <jpoimboe@kernel.org>

commit 9756bba28470722dacb79ffce554336dd1f6a6cd upstream.

Prevent RSB underflow/poisoning attacks with RSB.  While at it, add a
bunch of comments to attempt to document the current state of tribal
knowledge about RSB attacks and what exactly is being mitigated.
