Hello Dear Friend,

My name is Mr.Mohamed Allyson. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation  with you in the execution of the deal described
here-under for our both  mutual benefit and I hope you will keep it a
top secret because of the nature  of the transaction, During the
course of our bank year auditing, I discovered  an unclaimed/abandoned
fund, sum total of {US$19.3 Million United State  Dollars} in the bank
account that belongs to a Saudi Arabia businessman Who unfortunately
lost his life and entire family in a Motor Accident.

Now our bank has been waiting for any of the relatives to come-up for
the claim but nobody has done that. I personally has been unsuccessful
in locating any of the relatives, now, I sincerely seek your consent
to present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased
so that the proceeds of this account valued at {US$19.3 Million United
State Dollars} can be paid to you, which we will share in these
percentages ratio, 60% to me and 40% to you. All I request is your
utmost sincere co-operation; trust and maximum confidentiality to
achieve this project successfully. I have carefully mapped out the
moralities for execution of this transaction under a legitimate
arrangement to protect you from any breach of the law both in your
country and here in Burkina Faso when the fund is being transferred to
your bank account.

I will have to provide all the relevant document that will be
requested to indicate that you are the rightful beneficiary of this
legacy and our bank will release the fund to you without any further
delay, upon your consideration and acceptance of this offer, please
send me the following information as stated below so we can proceed
and get this fund transferred to your designated bank account
immediately.

-Your Full Name:
-Your Contact Address:
-Your direct Mobile telephone Number:
-Your Date of Birth:
-Your occupation:

I await your swift response and re-assurance.

Best regards,
Mr.Mohamed Allyson.
