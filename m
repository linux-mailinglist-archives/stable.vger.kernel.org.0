Dear Friend,

Please read carefully.

I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contact you independently and no one is informed of this communication. We can work together for our common good.

I am Chim Wai Kin, Chairman of the risk management committee at OCBC WING HANG BANK here in Hong Kong. I am getting in touch with you regarding the estate of a customer and an investment placed under our banks management over

10 years ago. In 2006, the subject matter; came to our office to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of $18.75 million United States dollars, which he wished to have us invest on his behalf.
However, this money has not been claimed. On further enquiries we found out that he was involved in an accident in Mainland China , which means he died intestate, He has no next of kin.

What I propose is that since I have exclusive access to his file, you will be made the beneficiary of these funds. My bank will contact you informing you that money has been willed to you. On verification, which will be the details I make available to my bank, my bank will make payments to you. You do not have to have known him. I know this might be a bit heavy for you but please trust me on this. For all your troubles I propose that we split the money in  half. In the banking circle this happens every time. The other option is that the

money will revert back to the state.Nobody is getting hurt; this is a  lifetime opportunity for us. I hold the KEY to these funds, and as a Chinese  National we see so much cash and funds being re-assigned daily. I would want  us to keep communication for now strictly by email.

Please, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to the consequences, but I know  within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches

never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should act swiftly on this. Please pardon my writing mistakes.

Please get back to me immediately with your details as follows so we may discuss more on this. EMAIL ME : chimwai24@gmail.com



1. Full Names and address

2. Telephone and fax number

3. Means of identification.


I await your response.

Regards
Chim Wai Kin
