I have nothing else pending, so feel free to take it directly:

That unfortunately does not work always work, as we have interfaces
where we expect data that is not written to by the device to remain
unchanged, and there are many cases where the device does not write
the whole buffer.  In various places like SCSI the data transfer
can be smaller, but even more common is the case of no data transfer
at all error cases.

There are three use case:
 - bounce buffering due to address limitations when no IOMMU is present
 - bounce buffering for not page aligned I/O on IOMMUs if the device
   is considered untrusted (which ã‚Šight now means thunderbolt attached)
 - unconditional bounce buffering for trusted hypervisor schemes

All of thee apply to all I/O.  SG_IO is just a vector here as a
particularly badly designed userspace interface that happens to get a
decent test coverage.  There unfortuately are plenty of other ways to
expose this issue as well.  We're thinking of building interfaces to
avoid the overhead for well designed interfaces, but it will take some
time.
