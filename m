This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    usb: dwc3: ulpi: Replace CPU-based busyloop with Protocol-based one

to my usb git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git
in the usb-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: usb: dwc3: ulpi: Replace CPU-based busyloop with Protocol-based one

Originally the procedure of the ULPI transaction finish detection has been
developed as a simple busy-loop with just decrementing counter and no
delays. It's wrong since on different systems the loop will take a
different time to complete. So if the system bus and CPU are fast enough
to overtake the ULPI bus and the companion PHY reaction, then we'll get to
take a false timeout error. Fix this by converting the busy-loop procedure
to take the standard bus speed, address value and the registers access
mode into account for the busy-loop delay calculation.

Here is the way the fix works. It's known that the ULPI bus is clocked
with 60MHz signal. In accordance with [1] the ULPI bus protocol is created
so to spend 5 and 6 clock periods for immediate register write and read
operations respectively, and 6 and 7 clock periods - for the extended
register writes and reads. Based on that we can easily pre-calculate the
time which will be needed for the controller to perform a requested IO
operation. Note we'll still preserve the attempts counter in case if the
DWC USB3 controller has got some internals delays.

[1] UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) Specification, Revision 1.1,
    October 20, 2004, pp. 30 - 36.
