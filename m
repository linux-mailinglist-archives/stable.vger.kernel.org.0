My beloved!

Peace be upon you

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as big surprise. Truly,  I came
across your contact email address through my personal search, then
afterward I decided to email you directly believing that you will be
honest to help me before i die.

Mean while, I am Dr . Mrs. Aisha Sultan Al suwaidi, President of
Emirates Dental Society, 62 years old from (United Arab Emirate),  a
registered doctor by profession but sadly I am suffering from long
time cancer and from all indication my condition is really
deteriorating as my doctors have confirmed and courageously advised me
that I may not live beyond two months from now for the reason that my
tumor has reached a critical stage which has defiled all forms of
medical treatment.

Actually, my husband was dealing on Gold Dust and Gold Dory Bars in
(Africa) Burkina Faso till his sudden death in the year 2011 then I
took over his business till date but currently, I have a deposit sum
of five million five hundred thousand US dollars [$5,500,000.00] with
one of the leading bank in Burkina Faso but unfortunately I cannot
visit the bank since I=E2=80=99m critically sick and powerless to do anythi=
ng
myself but my bank account officer advised me to assign any of my
trustworthy relative, friends or partner with authorization letter to
stand as the recipient of my money but sorrowfully my only beloved
daughter died at the age of 19 years and I don=E2=80=99t have any reliable
relative and no other child.

Therefore, I want you to receive the money and take 50%  as your share
while 50% should be use basically on humanitarian purposes mostly to
orphanages home, Motherless babies home, less privileged  around the
world. As soon as I receive your reply I will give you every details
you need.

Yours Faithfully,
Dr. Mrs.  Aisha Sultan Al suwaidi
