To whom it may concern,

Please kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited letter to you.
I believe you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact
that I sourced your profile from your Country Business Directory which
i have a business proposal for you, this however is not mandatory nor
will I in any manner compel you to honor against your wish.

Well, I am Attorney and a Solicitor at Law and the Personal Lawyer to
M.s.Nelda Parker Pace (LATE), Who is the Director and owner of
Sawgrass Realty, LLC Real Estate company in Abidjan - Cote Ivoire.

On the 3rd of July 2017, my client, a single mother of two Children
were involved in a car accident along express-high way. Unfortunately,
they all lost their lives. Since then I have made several inquiries to
her Country Embassy in United States of America to locate any of my
client's extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful and in
total vain.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his
relatives over the Internet but to no avail, hence i have contacted
you to assist in repatriating her money and property left behind by my
deceased client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable
by the Bank here. These huge deposits were lodged particularly with a
Bank in Abidjan - Cote Ivoire (Banque Atlantique), where the Deceased
had an account valued at Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars ($12.5 million dollars)

The Bank has issued me a final notice to provide the next of
Inheritance within one month or have the account confiscated. Since I
have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over three years,
I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of my deceased
client so the proceeds of this account valued at $12.5 million dollars
can be transferred to you and then our sharing ratio should be 50% for
you and 50% for me. I have all the necessary legal documents that can
be used to back up our claim with the Bank.

All I require is your honest and sincere co-operation to enable us see
this Deal through and I guarantee 100% risk free that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law and to achieve this i will need your kind efforts
and support.

I wait for your immediate reply as soon as possible if you are willing
and interested to assist me claim this fund for our sharing and
investment projects in your Country.Thank you.

Yours faithfully,

Attorney Roland Jones Esq
