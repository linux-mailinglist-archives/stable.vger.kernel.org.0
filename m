[ Upstream commit 9642fa73d073527b0cbc337cc17a47d545d82cd2 ]

Stopping external metadata arrays during resync/recovery causes
retries, loop of interrupting and starting reconstruction, until it
hit at good moment to stop completely. While these retries
curr_mark_cnt can be small- especially on HDD drives, so subtraction
result can be smaller than 0. However it is casted to uint without
checking. As a result of it the status bar in /proc/mdstat while stopping
is strange (it jumps between 0% and 99%).

The real problem occurs here after commit 72deb455b5ec ("block: remove
CONFIG_LBDAF"). Sector_div() macro has been changed, now the
divisor is casted to uint32. For db = -8 the divisior(db/32-1) becomes 0.

Check if db value can be really counted and replace these macro by
div64_u64() inline.
