commit 434537ae54ad37e93555de21b6ac8133d6d773a9 upstream.

In 79a8468747c5 ("random: check for increase of entropy_count because of
signed conversion"), a number of checks were added around what values
were passed to account(), because account() was doing fancy fixed point
fractional arithmetic, and a user had some ability to pass large values
directly into it. One of things in that commit was limiting those values
to INT_MAX >> 6. The first >> 3 was for bytes to bits, and the next >> 3
was for bits to 1/8 fractional bits.

However, for several years now, urandom reads no longer touch entropy
accounting, and so this check serves no purpose. The current flow is:

urandom_read_nowarn()-->get_random_bytes_user()-->chacha20_block()

Of course, we don't want that size_t to be truncated when adding it into
the ssize_t. But we arrive at urandom_read_nowarn() in the first place
either via ordinary fops, which limits reads to MAX_RW_COUNT, or via
getrandom() which limits reads to INT_MAX.
