Greetings,

My name is Mr.Comrade Vahid Armstrone, Chief Operating Financial
Officer Emirates Allied Investment bank, It is true that we have not
met each other in person, but I strongly believe in trust and
friendship in every business. As I am contacting you independently of
my investigation and no one is informed of this communication.

My reason for contacting you is to transfer an abandoned sum of
$10.5million Dollars immediately to your private account, the money
has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody
coming for the claim of it.

The funds belong to our deceased Customer Mrs.Shannel Lake who
perished along with her family since 9 years ago and the Banking laws
here does not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, that is the
reason why I need your Cooperation in transferring the money to your
account so that we can use it to secure the future of our both
families because I don't want the money to be recalled to the bank
treasury as unclaimed fund.

For the success of this operation, you should keep strictly
confidential what I have just confided in you. Only this condition can
allow us to achieve total success.

Mr. Comrade Vahid Armstrone.
Chief Operating Financial Officer,
EMIRATES ALLIED INVESTMENT BANK.
