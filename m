Dear Beneficiary,

I am Mrs. Mary Price. I am a US citizen and I am 52 years Old. I reside here in 6460 Ruleton Avenue Goodland, Kansas  67735, and I am thinking of relocating since I am now rich.

I am one of those that took part in the United Nations Compensation program many years ago and they refused to pay me. I had paid over $25,000 dollars while in the US, trying to get my payment but all was to no avail.

So I decided to travel down to Netherlands with all my compensation documents and I was directed to meet Mr. Michael Eric, who is the member of COMPENSATION PROGRAM COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake. He also took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment.

Right now, I am the happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of ( $5,000,000.00.) Moreover, Mr. Michael Eric showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you and informed you to stop dealing with those people because they are not with your fund, they are only making money from you.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mr. Michael Eric for assistance and inform him that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. You are to contact Mr. Michael Eric directly via the information below so that he can help you too.

UNITED NATIONS COMPENSATION AWARD PROGRAM.

Contact Name: Michael Eric
Direct Email:  michaeleric333@yahoo.com
Telephone Number: +3197005033351

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them because it is not with them. They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr. Michael Eric was just the bank transfer charges, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note of that Mr. Michael Eric shall ensure that you deal directly with the paying bank.

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you contact Mr. Michael Eric so that he can help you in the collection of your transfer payment/ATM Master Card instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kinds of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be blessed.

Mrs. Mary Price
