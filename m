Hmm, so instead of passing GpioIo/GpioInt resources to devices the
firmware uses some hard-coded Linux GPIO numbering scheme? Would you
able to share the exact firmware description where this happens?

Is it poking GPIOs directly through sysfs relying the Linux GPIO
numbering (which can change and is fragile anyway)?
