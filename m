Dear Sir/Ma.

My name is Mr. Geoffrey Mudenzi" a senior government official in
department of Public Works & Infrastructure here in South Africa, I am
the Chief of Staff in charge for contract awards / execution. also the
supervisor of all contracts in Department Of Public Works &
Infrastructure. In 2019, I personally monitored and supervised the
awarded contracts for supplies of building materials and constructions
of ultra modern shopping malls, low cost housing units, airports
maintenance and Stadiums to Improve the standard of living in this
country, In the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Natal and Gauteng
provinces here in South Africa.

My colleague and I serving in the board deliberately inflated and over
invoiced the contract sum, living an excess of US$30, 000,000.00
(Thirty Million United States Dollars Only). At the completion of the
contracts, the real contract sum was paid to the original contractors,
living the excess, which we reported to the Government that it
belonged to the sub-contractor that handled part of the original
contract. But the company we submitted as the beneficiary was
non-existing foreign company, which was a purported attempt by us to
divert the money for our private use. I do not intend to mince words
with you, I have to tell you the truth; this is a deal but completely
risk-free and genuine because the contract has been perfectly and
genuinely executed and completed. It depends on whether you are
interested or not.

Right now this amount is due for payment and is floating in the
treasury not attached to anyone/company. We are only two people who
know the origin of this fund. But we cannot claim it by ourselves
because we are civil servants therefore we are looking for a
trustworthy foreign company / individual whose name can be used to
claim this money for our mutual benefit.

This is strictly a business deal, but it=E2=80=99s completely risk-free and
secure because we will use our official positions to source all the
necessary approvals, official documents and certificates that will
back up the fund to reflect that you/your company genuinely executed
and completed the contract. All necessary arrangements have been put
in place in all the relevant departments for immediate approval of
this payment.

For your co-operation, we have agreed to offer you 2.5% of the entire
amount on conclusion of the transaction while 75% will be for us.
Please if you are interested in this proposal, I want you to respond
immediately through my personal e-mail account stated below for
further information and directives.

This transaction is expected to be completed within 5 or 8 work days
and is highly confidential and discreet. Thank you for your
co-operation. Your urgent reply is awaited through my private email
accounts below.

Best Regards,

Mr. Geoffrey Mudenzi.
