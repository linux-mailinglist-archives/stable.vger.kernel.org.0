My name is Mr Stephen Allan, a legal practitioner in London, United
Kingdom. I saw your contact and profile and decided that you could
cooperate with me in this proposition. I have a client, who was
deceased in November, 2013, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I am contacting
you because you have the same surname as my deceased client and i felt
that you could help me in the distribution of funding that were left
in my deceased client's bank account. This funding is closed to be
declared un-serviceable by the bank as there were no indicated next of
kin or next of beneficiary of the funding in the bank account.

The total amount of cash in the bank account of my deceased client is
US$ 11.3 Million ( Say, Eleven Million, three Hundred Thousand United
States dollars Only ), The bank had issued to me a notification to
contact the next of kin of my deceased client for either to
re-activate the bank account or to make claim of beneficiary, of the
funding in the bank account, with a month surcharge of 6% to be
deducted as an Escrow safe keeping fee of the bank account, so as to
avoid the indefinite closure of the bank account. My proposition to
you is to seek your consent, and to present your kind self as the
next-of-kin and beneficiary of my deceased client, since you have the
same last name with him.

This means that the proceeds of his bank account would be paid to you
as his next of kin or the legitimate beneficiary. When the proceeds in
his bank account are paid to you, we would share the proceeds on a
mutually agreed-upon percentage of 60% to me and 40% to your kind
self. All the legal documents to back up your claim as my client's
next-of-kin would be provided by me. The most important thing I would
need is your honest cooperation in this proposition. This would be
done under a legitimate arrangement that would protect you from any
breach of the law. If this business proposition offends your moral and
ethical values, feel free to back out. Please contact me at once if
you are interested.

Regards,

Stephen Allan  LLP
London, United Kingdom
