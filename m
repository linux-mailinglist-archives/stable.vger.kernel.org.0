3.16.83-rc1 review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit fdb838efa31e1ed9a13ae6ad0b64e30fdbd00570 upstream.

USB-serial drivers must not be unbound from their ports before the
corresponding USB driver is unbound from the parent interface so
suppress the bind and unbind attributes.

Unbinding a serial driver while it's port is open is a sure way to
trigger a crash as any driver state is released on unbind while port
hangup is handled on the parent USB interface level. Drivers for
multiport devices where ports share a resource such as an interrupt
endpoint also generally cannot handle individual ports going away.
