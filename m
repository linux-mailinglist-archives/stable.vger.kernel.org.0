Greetings,
 
I represent an International finance & investment company, and we are currently
expanding our business interest abroad.
 
We offer a wide range of financial services to interested companies, enterprises
or individuals who are looking for soft loans to finance their PROJECT, our
services are due at a very low & minimum rate of 2% to suit your needs.
 
We specialize in both start up projects and existing businesses needing funding
for expansion. It takes fewer than 21 days to release funds if you have an
existing business.
 
Please email us your Project executive summary or Business plan for review and
possible approval for funding (msimpson.aghillpartners@mail.ee).
 
Feel free to ask your questions.
 
Best Regards,
Marc Simpson
