This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    iio: light: vcnl4000: update sampling periods for vcnl4200

to my staging git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git
in the staging-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Vishay has published a new version of "Designing the VCNL4200 Into an
Application" application note in October 2019. The new version specifies
that there is +-20% of part to part tolerance. This explains the drift
seen during experiments. The proximity pulse width is also changed from
32us to 30us. According to the support, the tolerance also applies to
ambient light.

So update the sampling periods. As the reading is blocking, current
users may notice slightly longer response time.
