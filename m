Thorsten did question its upstreaming speed elsewhere. But it actually
is in 6.2-rc1. Andrew sent the PR on 22th and Linus merged on 23th [1].
I didn't try to accelerate it to stable as IIRC people already pointed
it out and you acknowledged it's on your radar, and it was a tracked
regression. Sucks that it didn't make it to 6.1.2.
