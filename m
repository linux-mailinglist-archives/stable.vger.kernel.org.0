Dear friend Contact my secretary for the delivering of your VISA CARD

I'm sorry but happy to inform you about my success in getting those
funds transferred under the co-operation of a new partner from
Paraguay though I tried my best to involve you in the Gold/diamond,
business but God decided the whole situations. Presently I am in
United Arab Emirates for investment projects with my own share of the
total sum.

Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me
in transferring those funds despite that it failed us somehow.

Now contact my secretary in Burkina Faso.

So feel free and get in touched with my secretary. Fifa Fete and
instruct him where to send the VISA CARD to you value sum of $
2.50000.000.00.USD.

this amount $ 1.50000.00.USD is from my own share while my new partner
supported you also with sum of $ 1000000.USD from his own share also
because I explain the whole thing to him that you are the first person
I contacted that wanted to assist me bet you could not make it and he
said okay there is no problem.

so that you will kept the whole secret about my success because I knew
that it was only you know how I made the money so try to kept
everything very secret. I hope you understand the reason why this huge
amount of funds was kept for you?

Please do let me know immediately you receive the VISA CARD so that we
can share the joy after all the sufferings at that time. In the
moment, I am very busy here because of the investment projects which I
and the new partner are having at hand, finally,

Remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your
behalf to receive that money, so feel free to keep in touch with him,
so that he will send the VISA CARD value of $2.50000.00.US D. Two
Million Fifty Thousand United State Dollars to you without any delay.
