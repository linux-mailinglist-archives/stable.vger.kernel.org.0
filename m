Hmm, I think my current fix is incomplete if not wrong.  The root cause
should still be valid, however I overlooked another path:

	if (page_mapcount(old_page) == 1 && PageAnon(old_page)) {
		if (!PageAnonExclusive(old_page))
			page_move_anon_rmap(old_page, vma);
		if (likely(!unshare))
			set_huge_ptep_writable(vma, haddr, ptep);

		delayacct_wpcopy_end();
		return 0;
	}

We should bail out early in this path, and it'll be even easier we always
bail out hugetlb_wp() as long as uffd-wp is detected because userfault
should always be handled before any decision to CoW.

v2 attached.. Please give it another shot.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH v2] mm/hugetlb: Fix uffd wr-protection for CoW optimization path

This patch fixes an issue that a hugetlb uffd-wr-protected mapping can be
writable even with uffd-wp bit set.  It only happens with hugetlb private
mappings, when someone firstly wr-protects a missing pte (which will
install a pte marker), followed by a write to the page.  That will trigger
a missing fault and an optimized CoW in the same fault stack.

Userfaultfd-wp trap for hugetlb was implemented in hugetlb_fault() before
even reaching hugetlb_wp() to avoid taking more locks that userfault won't
need.  However there's one CoW optimization path for missing hugetlb page
that can trigger hugetlb_wp() inside hugetlb_no_page(), that can bypass the
userfaultfd-wp traps.

A few ways to resolve this:

  (1) Skip the CoW optimization for hugetlb private mapping, considering
  that private mappings for hugetlb should be very rare, so it may not
  really be helpful to major workloads.  The worst case is we only skip the
  optimization if userfaultfd_wp(vma)==true, because uffd-wp needs another
  fault anyway.

  (2) Move the userfaultfd-wp handling for hugetlb from hugetlb_fault()
  into hugetlb_wp().  The major cons is there're a bunch of locks taken
  when calling hugetlb_wp(), and that will make the changeset unnecessarily
  complicated due to the lock operations.

  (3) Skip hugetlb_wp() when uffd-wp bit is still set.  It means it
  requires another hugetlb_fault() to resolve the uffd-wp bit first.

This patch chose option (3) which contains the minimum changeset (simplest
for backport) and also make sure hugetlb_wp() itself will start to be
always safe with uffd-wp ptes even if called elsewhere in the future.

This patch will be needed for v5.19+ hence copy stable.
