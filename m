My Dear,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings to you in the
name of our lord, and I hope this letter meets you in good time, I
Propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity from God, I
know that this message will appear as a surprise to you that we barely
Know but the grace of God directed me to you and I wish you read this
message and be blessed in name of the Lord.

I have a brain tumor; I suffer terribly at the moment. My doctor just
informed me that my days are numbered because of my health therefore
condemned to certain death. Currently, I have exhausted all my savings
for my medical care.

But I do have some funds for my charity project; these funds are
deposited with one of the security Company here In Cote D'Ivoire West
Africa. Purposed for charitable foundation, my marital status is such
that I'm single because I lost my Husband over 9 years now and
unfortunately we have not had a child together, which I am no one to
leave my legacy for. Therefore, to release my funds I would like to
make a donation so that there is no stiff tax on my money.

To this I would be so graceful and in order to help the poor to give
what amounts to said legacy worth four Million Euros (=E2=82=AC4,000,000.00
Million Euros) to enable you establish a charitable foundation in my
memory so that the grace of God be with me until my last home so I can
receive an honorable place with the Lord our father.

I have no fear because before contacted you, I have several nights
prayed for the Lord to give me the contact of a trusted person of whom
I can entrust this matter and I believe my contacts to you is divine.

Know that you can keep 30% of the money for yourself and the rest will
be used to create a charitable foundation in my memory and a
federation in the fight against cancer and also build orphanages.

I count on your goodwill and especially on the proper use of these
funds have something I do not doubt because I have great confidence in
you that God may guide me toward you.  My email

Awaiting your prompt reply, receive my cordial and fraternal greetings.

Yours Sincerely,
Mrs.Diana Ackerstaff
