Dear Linux folks,


Could you please apply commit 0c25422d34b4 (scsi: mpt3sas: Remove 
scsi_dma_map() error messages) to the 5.15.y series?

     scsi: mpt3sas: Remove scsi_dma_map() error messages

     When scsi_dma_map() fails by returning a sges_left value less than 
zero,
     the amount of logging produced can be extremely high.  In a recent 
end-user
     environment, 1200 messages per second were being sent to the log 
buffer.
     This eventually overwhelmed the system and it stalled.

     These error messages are not needed. Remove them.

We see this regression after upgrading from Linux 5.10 to 5.15 on our 
file servers with Broadcom/LSI SAS3008 PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS-3 
(mpt3sas) – though luckily our systems do not stall/crash.

The commit message does not say anything about, what commit caused these 
error to be appearing – the log statements have been there since 
v4.20-rc1, if I am not mistaken, so it must be something else –, and 
also do not mention, why these log messages are not needed, but the new 
error condition is actually expected.

In the Canonical/Ubuntu bug tracker I found the explanation below [2].

> 2. mpt3sas: Remove scsi_dma_map errors messages:
> When driver set the DMA mask to 32bit then we observe that the
> SWIOTLB bounce buffers are getting exhausted quickly. For most of the
> IOs driver observe that scsi_dma_map() API returned with failure
> status and hence driver was printing below error message. Since this
> error message is getting printed per IO and if user issues heavy IOs
> then we observe that kernel overwhelmed with this error message. Also
> we will observe the kernel panic when the serial console is enabled.
> So to limit this issue, we removed this error message though this
> patch.
> "scsi_dma_map failed: request for 1310720 bytes!"

The Launchpad issue was created in March 2022, and the fixed Linux 
kernel package 5.15.0-53.59 for Ubuntu 22.04 released on November 15th, 
2022.

Sreekanth, looking again, you are the patch author, one of the Broadcom 
maintainers (LSILOGIC MPT FUSION DRIVERS (FC/SAS/SPI)) and created the 
Launchpad bug report. I am surprised you didn’t get it backported upstream.


Kind regards,

Paul
