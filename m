Greetings Dearest One,

How are you today, together with your family?Hope fine.I would like to
use this opportunity to introduce myself to you. I am Miss Reneta
Williams, From Benin Republic, West Africa. And my late parents are
Mr. and Mrs. Dikko Williams; my father was a highly reputable business
magnet who operated in Benin Republic during his days.

I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.
With due respect trust and humanity, I know this mail will come to you
as a surprise since we haven't known or come across each other before,
considering the fact that I sourced your email contact through the
Internet in search of trusted person who can be trusted and will
assist me.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one
of his business trips abroad. Though his sudden death was linked or
rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who
traveled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother
died when I was just 6yrs old, and since then my father took me so
special.

Before his death, he called me and informed me that he has the sum of
Eighteen Million Five Hundred , United State Dollar
(USD$18.500,000.00) left in fixed deposit account in one of the
leading banks in Africa. He further told me that he deposited the
money in my name, and also gave me all the necessary but legal
documents to this fund with the bank.

I am 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know
what to do. Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this
funds and after the transaction I will come and reside permanently in
your country till such a time that it will be convenient for me to
return back home if I so desire.

The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want
to invest the fund under your care because I am ignorant of business
world. I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this
regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.

Now permit me to ask these few questions:

1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?

2. Can I completely trust you?

3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for
you after the money is in your account?

Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as
possible.Immediately and confirm your willingness on this my
email(williamsreneta2019@gmail.com), here is one of my Picture and
also i will inform you more details involved in this matter.

Regards,

Miss Reneta Williams.
