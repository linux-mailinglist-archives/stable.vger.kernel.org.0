That's my position as well. This isn't a bug fix at all, but a
workaround for a HW defect with complex dependencies. It wasn't cc'd
stable for good reasons, and I wish stable maintainers would respect
this decision.

I have this exact machine keeping my feet warm, and kexec never worked
on it (nor on any GICv3 machine that is LPI-capable) before we added
this workaround.  Whatever distros carried as hacks to make it work at
the time, I don't want to know. What is more likely is that they always
kexec'd a kernel with the exact same allocation layout and that it
worked by luck (or maybe resulted in silent memory corruption).

If anything, I'd merge a patch *disabling* kexec altogether on these
systems, because pretending that it ever worked is a damn lie.

Ideally, I'd like the distros to test these backports, because only them
have access to the variety of HW that's required. But they'd have to
majorly up their game, if the above is anything to go by...
