"finally" being all the way back in 2015
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/11/9/422), and getting no contributions from
3rd parties for the next 7 years.

Really, we're not pushing back on ideas, we're just saying that this is
something has happened before ("open up your scripts so we can
reuse/improve") and getting nowhere.

Not as much as closed source as a complete mess on a VM I'm afraid to
lose.

I didn't really want to try and invest the effort into extracting it out
becuase:

1. It's one of the first things I did when I started learning about
neural networks, and in practice it's inefficient and could use a
massive overhaul (or rewrite). For example, it currently has ~15k
inputs, which means that it needs a beefy GPU to be able to run on (it
won't run on your home GPU)..

2. At that time I wasn't familiar with coding for NN either, so it's a
mess of LUA code to run under Torch (yes, not even pytorch).

3. It's very tied to how VMs on Azure operate, and could use a lot of
abstraction.

So really, I'd much rather invest effort into rewriting this mess rather
than digging it out of the crevices of the VM it's sitting in.

FTR, I'm happy to shift investment into tooling for stable maintenance
into b4.
