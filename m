They're still at least 20 cycles a pop, uncontended.

Is that Apache-MPM workload triggering this lots? Having a known
benchmark for this stuff is good for when someone has time to play with
things.

We have an interval_tree for this, and yes, that's how far I got :/

The other thing I was thinking of is trying to detect overlap through
the page-tables themselves, but we have a distinct lack of storage
there.

The things is, if this threaded monster runs on all CPUs (busy front end
server) and does a ton of invalidation due to all the short lived
request crud, then all the extra invalidations will add up too. Having
to do process (machine in this case) wide invalidations is expensive,
having to do more of them surely isn't cheap either.

So there might be something to win here.
