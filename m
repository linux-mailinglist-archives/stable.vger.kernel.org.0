[ Upstream commit 5bfa685e62e9ba93c303a9a8db646c7228b9b570 ]

It appears that a read access to GIC[DR]_I[CS]PENDRn doesn't always
result in the pending interrupts being accurately reported if they are
mapped to a HW interrupt. This is particularily visible when acking
the timer interrupt and reading the GICR_ISPENDR1 register immediately
after, for example (the interrupt appears as not-pending while it really
is...).

This is because a HW interrupt has its 'active and pending state' kept
in the *physical* distributor, and not in the virtual one, as mandated
by the spec (this is what allows the direct deactivation). The virtual
distributor only caries the pending and active *states* (note the
plural, as these are two independent and non-overlapping states).

Fix it by reading the HW state back, either from the timer itself or
from the distributor if necessary.
