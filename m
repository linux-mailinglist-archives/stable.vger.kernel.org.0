[ Upstream commit 3d57f36c89d8ba32b2c312f397a37fd1a2dc7cfc ]

I no longer work for Plantronics (aka Poly, aka HP) and do not have
access to the headsets in order to test. However, as noted by Maxim,
the other 32xx models that share the same base code set as the 3220
would need the same quirk. This patch adds the PIDs for the rest of
the Blackwire 32XX product family that require the quirk.

Plantronics Blackwire 3210 Series (047f:c055)
Plantronics Blackwire 3215 Series (047f:c057)
Plantronics Blackwire 3225 Series (047f:c058)

Quote from previous patch by Maxim Mikityanskiy
Plantronics Blackwire 3220 Series (047f:c056) sends HID reports twice
for each volume key press. This patch adds a quirk to hid-plantronics
for this product ID, which will ignore the second volume key press if
it happens within 5 ms from the last one that was handled.

The patch was tested on the mentioned model only, it shouldn't affect
other models, however, this quirk might be needed for them too.
Auto-repeat (when a key is held pressed) is not affected, because the
rate is about 3 times per second, which is far less frequent than once
in 5 ms.
