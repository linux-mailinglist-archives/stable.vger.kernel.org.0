Dear Sir/Madam

My name is Geraldine Darina Fode. I have interest in investing in your
country into a Joint-Investment and I have funds deposited in a Bank here
by my late father. I am contacting you because I need your urgent help to
secure my money that my late father kept in a bank in my name before he
died. And i will tell you the actual amount involved upon receiving your
response, because of my age I cannot be able to handle it by myself that
is why I am contacting you due stability in your country and want you to
invest the fund for me in a good venture while i will continue my
education.

Upon getting Response from you, I will let you know the actual amount of
the money that is involved and the country where the money is being kept
and as well send you the original copies of deposit documents in my
possession. Note that I am doing this because of security reasons. You
will stand as my guardian before the bank and receive the money in your
account on my behalf through bank Trans.

Please I will like you to reply to my message so that I will send to you
the more details, so that you can contact them.

Your Sincerely

Geraldine.
