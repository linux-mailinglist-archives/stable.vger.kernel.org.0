From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit 18f694385c4fd77a09851fd301236746ca83f3cb upstream.

Instead of relying on PF_EXITING use an explicit state for the futex exit
and set it in the futex exit function. This moves the smp barrier and the
lock/unlock serialization into the futex code.

As with the DEAD state this is restricted to the exit path as exec
continues to use the same task struct.

This allows to simplify that logic in a next step.
