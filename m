Dear Friend:

I am sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner, I find 
it appropriate to offer you my partnership in business, I only 
pray at this time that your email address is still valid. I am 
contacting you because my status would not permit me to do this 
alone.

I want to solicit your attention to receive money on my behalf. 
Can I trust you to do business?

I will send you the full details when I receive your reply.

Best wishes.
