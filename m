Hello!

I did some archeology and found some more details about this problem.

rmmoding bq module without that patch at that time sometimes caused oops
and reboot of N900 device. backtrace of crash contained:

I dig more in my disk storage and private archives and found following
email from Ivaylo which describe that problem and is also source of that
patch. I hope that Ivo would not be against putting copy of it here :-)

Hi,

The bug in bq27x00_battery is in function bq27x00_battery_poll. What happens is that after all pending poll work requests are canceled with cancel_delayed_work_sync(&di->work); in function bq27x00_powersupply_unregister  there is a call to power_supply_unregister(&di->bat); which in turn calls bq27x00_battery_get_property. And bq27x00_battery_get_property calls
bq27x00_battery_poll which leads to another delayed poll work queued. So after the timer expires kernel tries to execute a function in an already unloaded module, so OOPS ;)

The fix would be to set poll_interval = 0; in bq27x00_powersupply_unregister so the function will look like:

static  void  bq27x00_powersupply_unregister(struct  bq27x00_device_info  *di)

{

        poll_interval = 0;

        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&di->work);

        power_supply_unregister(&di->bat);

        mutex_destroy(&di->lock);

}

thus no new delayed work to be scheduled in function bq27x00_battery_poll.

Hope the above helps.

And... I found another discussion about crash in bq27x00 battery driver:
