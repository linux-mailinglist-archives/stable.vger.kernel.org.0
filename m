Hello

I write to you based on a request by an investor who is in urgent
needs to relocate his assets into your country through your
assistance, I am an attorney/investment advisers here in USA. I am
representing the interests of very wealthy investors mainly from East
and North Africa. Due to the sensitivity of their position they hold
in their organization and the unstable investment environment of their
countries, they prefer to channel/move majority of their funds into
more stable economies and developing nations where they can get good
yield for their assets and its safety.

This reserved group of individuals, whom our firm personally holding
there asset instructed and approached us with a mandate to seek for a
firm or an individual such as yourself who has the experience and
capacity to receive their assets and re-invest it into a good
lucrative investment.They will be interested to seeking means of
expanding and relocating his business interest in the following
sectors: Banking/Finance, Real estate, Stock , Resort/hospitality
industry , Mining, Transportation, Health Sector and Farming, Airline,
Shipping, Oil and Gas, Energy Projects and so on or any sector you may
recommend will be considered.

I have been given the full authority to negotiate with you on the
working Terms, so long as you can demonstrate that you have the
capacity to handle the project. I can be reached on phone, but will
like to keep the number discrete for now, until when I read from you.

Best Regards,

Mr.Fredrick Martins.
Personal representative
