HELLO DEAR FRIEND,THIS IS URGENT PLEASE

  My name is Mr. kelvin.Neil. I have decided to seek a confidential
  co-operation  with you in the execution of the deal described
  here-under for our both  mutual benefit and I hope you will keep it a
  top secret because of the nature  of the transaction, During the
  course of our bank year auditing, I discovered  an unclaimed/abandoned
  fund, sum total of {US$10.5 Million United State  Dollars} in the bank
  account that belongs to a Saudi Arabia businessman Who unfortunately
  lost his life and entire family in a Motor Accident.

  Now our bank has been waiting for any of the relatives to come-up for
  the claim but nobody has done that. I personally has been unsuccessful
  in locating any of the relatives, now, I sincerely seek your consent
  to present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased
  so that the proceeds of this account valued at {US$10.5 Million United
  State Dollars} can be paid to you, which we will share in these
  percentages ratio, 60% to me and 40% to you. All I request is your
  utmost sincere co-operation; trust and maximum confidentiality to
  achieve this project successfully. I have carefully mapped out the
  moralities for execution of this transaction under a legitimate
  arrangement to protect you from any breach of the law both in your
  country and here in Burkina Faso when the fund is being transferred to
  your bank account.

  I will have to provide all the relevant document that will be
  requested to indicate that you are the rightful beneficiary of this
  legacy and our bank will release the fund to you without any further
  delay, upon your consideration and acceptance of this offer, please
  send me the following information as stated below so we can proceed
  and get this fund transferred to your designated bank account
  immediately.
