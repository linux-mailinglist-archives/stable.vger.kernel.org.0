spare some of your valuable minutes to read the following appeal with
a sympathetic mind and understanding.

I am Mrs Pam Amos I am 59 years old, I am dropping this short
message from my sick bed after being diagnosed from a long time cancer
of the blood.

From all indications my condition is really deteriorating, and my
doctor has courageously advised that I may not live beyond the next
two months, this is because the Seriousness of the cancer has reached
a critical stage.

I am looking for a trust and Good someone to confide in.

I have a fortune/Project ($4.5M) I want to entrust into your care you
will use this money to help the needy, motherless, orphans and widows
because I am one .

Please respond to me if you promise to see that my last wish will be
accomplished to the Glory of God and humanity.

As soon as I hear from you, I will give you more information on this.

May God bless you real good Amen.

Mrs Pam Amos
