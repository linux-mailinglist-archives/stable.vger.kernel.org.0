[ Upstream commit bd3664b362381c4c1473753ebedf0ab242a60d1d ]

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue, say Q2, and the last sync bfq_queue created, say Q1. To this
goal, BFQ stores the address of Q1 in the field bic->stable_merge_bfqq
of the bic associated with Q2. So, when the time for the possible merge
arrives, BFQ knows which bfq_queue to merge Q2 with. In particular,
BFQ checks for possible merges on request arrivals.

Yet the same bic may also be associated with an async bfq_queue, say
Q3. So, if a request for Q3 arrives, then the above check may happen
to be executed while the bfq_queue at hand is Q3, instead of Q2. In
this case, Q1 happens to be merged with an async bfq_queue. This is
not only a conceptual mistake, because async queues are to be kept out
of queue merging, but also a bug that leads to inconsistent states.

This commits simply filters async queues out of delayed merges.
