There seems to be something different in your setup because memory less
nodes have reportedly worked on x86. I suspect something must be
different in your setup. Maybe it is that you are adding a cpu that is
outside of possible cpus intialized during boot time. Those should have
their nodes initialized properly - at least per init_cpu_to_node. Your
report doesn't really explain how the cpu is hotadded. Maybe you are
trying to do something that has never been supported on x86.

It would be really great if you can provide more information in the
original email thread. E.g. boot time messges and then more details
about the hotplug operation as well (e.g. which cpu, the node
association, how it is injected to the guest etc.).

Thanks!
