I am Lung Niu, am battling a serious infectious disease and my chances of
survival according to the doctor is next to zero. Reach out to my lawyer
Andy Elsagood on goodelsaandy@gmail.com for maximum assistance towards the
release of my funds in a US Bank, i want you to help orphans and widows
worldwide. If i don't survive this, build a disease research center in my
name.
