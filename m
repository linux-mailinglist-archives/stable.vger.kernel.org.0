The change should just move code outside of the scheduler and not lead
to any changed behaviour (except the small detail mentioned in the
changelog, nothing explaining what you have here).

The way the call chain looks is, kthread() allocated the struct kthread
(self) and saved it in current->set_child_tid and this pointer is not
NULL. Everything works out and `threadfn' is invoked which is
worker_thread().
The first thing it does, is to set the special kworker flag via
set_pf_worker() which enables the additional code in the scheduler. Then
it has nothing to do and invokes schedule() which then gets us to
wq_worker_sleeping(). Here it invokes wq_worker_sleeping() which is what
explodes.
Based on the register dump and code dump, RAX is NULL which is
current->set_child_tid (from the begin of ktread()). It adds 0x10 for
the ->date pointer and OOPSes while reading from 0x10.

So everything looks fine, except that `set_child_tid' seems to be zeroed
out. Also, task_struct has a few lines after `set_child_tid' the `comm'
member which seems to contain also 0x00 because the trace contains no
task name. At this point I would have expected "kworker/â€¦".

Based on this two hints it looks like something zeroed that memory area
shortly after it was occupied by the task (aka use after free).
