[ Upstream commit c71369de02b285d9da526a526d8f2affc7b17c59 ]

The coresight components could be operated either in sysfs mode or in perf
mode. For some of the components, the mode of operation doesn't matter as
they simply relay the data to the next component in the trace path. But for
sinks, they need to be able to provide the trace data back to the user.
Thus we need to make sure that "mode" is handled appropriately. e.g,
the sysfs mode could have multiple sources driving the trace data, while
perf mode doesn't allow sharing the sink.

The coresight_enable_sink() however doesn't really allow this check to
trigger as it skips the "enable_sink" callback if the component is
already enabled, irrespective of the mode. This could cause mixing
of data from different modes or even same mode (in perf), if the
sources are different. Also, if we fail to enable the sink while
enabling a path (where sink is the first component enabled),
we could end up in disabling the components in the "entire"
path which were not enabled in this trial, causing disruptions
in the existing trace paths.
