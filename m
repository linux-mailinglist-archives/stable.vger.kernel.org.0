Greetings,

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never
met before, but need not to worry as I am contacting you independently
of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I
need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $11,300,000.00
USD immediately to your private account.The money has been here in our
Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim
of it.

I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased
customer (the account owner) who died along with his supposed NEXT OF
KIN since 16th October 2005. The Banking laws here does not allow such
money to stay more than 15 years, because the money will be recalled
to the Bank treasury account as an unclaimed fund.

By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how
the business will be executed.

Please respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.

Best Regards,
Mr. Afrin Gawa
