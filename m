Should be per who? We explicitly do not order the lock acquire store.
qspinlock has the exact same issue.

If you look in the git history surrounding spin_is_locked(), you'll find
'lovely' things.

Basically, if you're doing crazy things with spin_is_locked() you get to
keep the pieces.

This doesn't make sense, there is no such thing as a store-acquire. What
you're doing here is moving the acquire from one load to the next. A
load we know will load the exact same value.

Also see Documentation/atomic_t.txt:

  {}_acquire: the R of the RMW (or atomic_read) is an ACQUIRE


If anything this code wants to be written like so.
