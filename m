This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    iio: trigger: Fix reference counting

to my char-misc git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc.git
in the char-misc-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: iio: trigger: Fix reference counting
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

In viio_trigger_alloc() device_initialize() is used to set the initial
reference count of the trigger to 1. Then another get_device() is called on
trigger. This sets the reference count to 2 before the trigger is returned.

iio_trigger_free(), which is the matching API to viio_trigger_alloc(),
calls put_device() which decreases the reference count by 1. But the second
reference count acquired in viio_trigger_alloc() is never dropped.

As a result the iio_trigger_release() function is never called and the
memory associated with the trigger is never freed.

Since there is no reason for the trigger to start its lifetime with two
reference counts just remove the extra get_device() in
viio_trigger_alloc().

Fixes: 5f9c035cae18 ("staging:iio:triggers. Add a reference get to the core for triggers.")
