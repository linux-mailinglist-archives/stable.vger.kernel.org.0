this money then use the funds for Charity works. I WISH TO GIVE THIS

network after honest prayers to the LORD to bring me a helper and i
decided to contact you if you may be willing and interested to handle
these trust funds in good faith before anything happens to me.

inherit this money after I die. I want your urgent reply to me so that
I will give you the deposit receipt which
the COMPANY issued to me as next of king for immediate transfer of the
money to your account in your country, to start the good work of God,
I want you to use the 40/percent of the total amount to help yourself
in doing the project.

I am desperately in keen need of assistance and I have summoned up
courage to contact you for this task, you must not fail me and the
millions of the poor people in our today=E2=80=99s
WORLD. This is not stolen money and there are no dangers involved,100%
RISK FREE with full legal proof. Please if you would be able to use
the funds for the Charity works kindly let me know immediately. I will
appreciate your utmost confidentiality and trust in this matter to
accomplish my heart desire, as I don't want anything that will
jeopardize my last wish. I want you to take 40 percent of the total
money for your personal use while 60% of the money will go to charity.
I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality and trust in this
matter to accomplish my heart desire, as I don't want anything that
will jeopardize my last wish as i said before please.

Finally, i will give you more details about the project as soon as I
receive your reply in my private email (estelleherve03@gmail.com) to
