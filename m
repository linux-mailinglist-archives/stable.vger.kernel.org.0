Dear Shimoda-san, dear reviewers,

Your development and reviewing effort to reach v4 is very appreciated.

However, in the context of some internal reviews of this patch, we are
having hard times reconciling the change with our (possibly incomplete
or inaccurate) interpretation of the R-Car3 HW Userâ€™s Manual (Rev.2.00
Jul 2019). The latter says in
Chapter "54. PCIE Controller" / "(2) Initial Setting of PCI Express":

 ----snip----
 Be sure to write the initial value (= H'80FF 0000) to MACCTLR before
 enabling PCIETCTLR.CFINIT.
 ----snip----

Is my assumption correct that the description of this patch is a
rewording of the above quote from the manual or is there another more
precise statement referring to resetting LSB only (w/o touching the
rest of the MACCTLR bits)?

If it is only the LSB which "should be written to 0 before enabling
PCIETCTLR.CFINIT", would you agree that the statement quoted from the
manual would better be rephrased appropriately? TIA.
