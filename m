It's my fault I'm afraid. My apologies. We have been needing the "Break 
infinite loop" patch at least since v5.10. Without IIRC we can not even 
boot normally or at least we have no dwc3. No way to bisect. In my mind 
I didn'tÂ  link that patch to this issue. Other patches were indeed 
removed during bisecting.

But it is interesting that we should be able to drop that patch for 
v6.0, even if that is a side effect. I will try to reproduce and report 
back here.
