As I think this is the first time that I've had this problem for a DRM
submission, I don't think it's a big issue yet at all, so whatever you
are doing today is fine.

I do think that the number of patches submitted for stable for
drm-related issues feels very very low given the rate of change and
number of overall patches you all submit to the kernel, so if anything,
you all should be increasing the number of times you tag stuff for
stable, not reducing it :)
