Dear Partner,

I am Mr. Desmond Edward, I work with the Bank for Africa (BOA) Bank in
the republic of Burkina Faso, West Africa. I am the account officer to
a deceased client of our bank, who died and left his fund in our bank
unclaimed. I need your urgent assistance in applying to our bank as
the business partner / legal beneficiary to this unclaimed fund of our
late client.

The amount involved is $7.500.000 (Seven Millions Five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars) and this money is lying in a dormant account in
our bank unclaimed. I want to let you know that my financial
transactions are monitored as a banker, so I want everything to be
done in your name as the legal beneficiary because the deceased was a
foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as the foreign beneficiary. I
will give you all backing information to prove that you are the
legitimate beneficiary to this fund.

Once the fund has been approved in your name & favor and transferred
to your bank account, 50% will be for you and 50% for me after
deducting all our expenses incurred during the fund transfer into any
of your receiving giving bank account of your choice. I will also need
your advice on any good investment opportunities in your country,
because I will like to invest my share in your country for my
retirement projects. Please, I want you to keep our communications
very private for total security reasons and I wait for your urgent
response, so that I can give you more details on what to do precisely,

My sincere greetings to you and your family.

Mr. Desmond Edward.
