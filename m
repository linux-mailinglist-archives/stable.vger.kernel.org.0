commit d62b23c94952e78211a383b7d90ef0afbd9a3717 upstream.

If we abort a transaction we have the following sequence

if (!trans->dirty && list_empty(&trans->new_bgs))
	return;
WRITE_ONCE(trans->transaction->aborted, err);

The idea being if we didn't modify anything with our trans handle then
we don't really need to abort the whole transaction, maybe the other
trans handles are fine and we can carry on.

However in the case of create_snapshot we add a pending_snapshot object
to our transaction and then commit the transaction.  We don't actually
modify anything.  sync() behaves the same way, attach to an existing
transaction and commit it.  This means that if we have an IO error in
the right places we could abort the committing transaction with our
trans->dirty being not set and thus not set transaction->aborted.

This is a problem because in the create_snapshot() case we depend on
pending->error being set to something, or btrfs_commit_transaction
returning an error.

If we are not the trans handle that gets to commit the transaction, and
we're waiting on the commit to happen we get our return value from
cur_trans->aborted.  If this was not set to anything because sync() hit
an error in the transaction commit before it could modify anything then
cur_trans->aborted would be 0.  Thus we'd return 0 from
btrfs_commit_transaction() in create_snapshot.

This is a problem because we then try to do things with
pending_snapshot->snap, which will be NULL because we didn't create the
snapshot, and then we'll get a NULL pointer dereference like the
following

"BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000001f0"

 do_syscall_64+0x4a/0x1b0

In order to fix this we need to make sure anybody who calls
commit_transaction has trans->dirty set so that they properly set the
trans->transaction->aborted value properly so any waiters know bad
things happened.

This was found while I was running generic/475 with my modified
fsstress, it reproduced within a few runs.  I ran with this patch all
night and didn't see the problem again.
