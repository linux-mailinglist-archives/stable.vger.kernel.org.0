Dear Sir/Madam,

Although you might be apprehensive about my email as we have never met
before. I am Mr.Patrick Joseph, a Banker and Head of Operations with
Bank here in Burkina Faso West Africa, there is the sum of
$28.500,000.00 Million Dollars currently in my branch, there were no
beneficiary stated concerning these funds which means no one would
ever come to claim it.

That is why I ask that can we work together, I will be pleased to work
with you as trusted person and see that the fund is transferred out of
my Bank into another Bank Account, Once the funds have been
transferred to your nominated Bank account we shall then share it in
the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.

If you agree to my business proposal.further details of the transfer
will be forwarded to you as soon as i receive your return mail,
sending the below information

1. Full Name.
2: Your Private telephone and Fax numbers.
3. Occupations.
4. Date Of Birth
5. Country of Residence.
6. Your full address.

Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.

Regards,
Mr.Patrick Joseph.
