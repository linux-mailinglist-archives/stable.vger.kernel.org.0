Given that the two commits touch entirely separate files I'm not sure 
what the imagined dependency could be :/

0036bc73ccbe is indeed not a fix (frankly I'm not convinced it's even a 
valid change at all) but even conceptually it bears no relation 
whatsoever to the genuine bug fixed by 449fa54d6815.
