Warm Greerings

My name is Chan Sokheng,a personal Accountant/Board Member working with Foreign Trade Bank of Cambodia (FTB). I have an interesting business proposal for you that will be of immense benefit to both of us.

A deceased client of mine that shares almost the same name as yours died as a result of heart-related condition on march 2005.His heart condition was duo to the death of the members of his family in the tsunami disaster on the 26 December 2004 in Sumatra Indonesia where they all lost their live.

There is a draft account opened in our bank by him in 1999. He was a CEO/a textile company owner,business man,a miner at kruger mining company here in Cambodia. he was a geologist and consultant to several other mining conglomerates operating Cambodia,China,Taiwan,Japan,Indonesia,Pakistan,Vietnam all in Asia,before he passed away on 12th march 2005 leaving nobody as the next of kin of his account after his death.

The amount in this account is currently ($32,640,000 (Thirty Two Million Six Hundred and Forty Thousand United States Dollars) I want to present you as a beneficiary,I will use my position and influence in our bank to make them release this money to you for us to share.

Most importantly, I will need you to promise to keep whatever you learn from me between us even if you decide not to go along with me. I will make more details available to you on receipt of a positive response from you.

I am in good faith and with trust waiting for your Urgent respond and maximum cooperation for more details.
