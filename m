I don't think so.

Ehem. Yes.

It seems to have been a quick patch to solve a power sequencing issue:

"The ULPI bus code supports native enumeration by reading the
vendor ID and product ID registers at device creation time, but
we can't be certain that those register reads will succeed if the
phy is not powered up. To avoid any problems with reading the ID
registers before the phy is powered we fallback to DT matching
when the ID reads fail.

If the ULPI spec had some generic power sequencing for these
registers we could put that into the ULPI bus layer and power up
the device before reading the ID registers. Unfortunately this
doesn't exist and the power sequence is usually device specific.
By having the device matched up with DT we can avoid this
problem."

But as is, the code now requires a DT when there is a power
sequencing issue, which is wrong for Merrifield. It seems my patch
breaks the OF path, by replacing that by a deferred probe.

I'm thinking the correct way would be:
- if present use DT
- else if test write fails, defer probe
- else enumeration by reading the vendor ID and product ID registers
