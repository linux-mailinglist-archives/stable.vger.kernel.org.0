Dear friend,

In a brief introduction, I am Barrister Moses Morrow, a lawyer by
profession and the personal attorney to engineer. a foreigner who died
in my country with his family years ago, leaving behind a huge sum of
money in a bank in my country. I am his attorney and I am searching
for his relatives, I need your assistance to receive the sum of
(US$9.600.000 million US dollars). from the bank in my country. The
said fund was abandoned in the bank by my deceased client. The bank
management has issued me several notices and has mandated me to
provide the deceased Next of Kin or relative before the next 21
working days otherwise the fund will be confiscated at the expiration
of the deadline. Of-course I know that you might not be related to my
deceased client, but do not worry about that this is my field and I am
assuring you that this transaction is 100% risk free and will be
executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law.

Thanks for your understanding.
Yours truly.
Barrister Moses Morrow
