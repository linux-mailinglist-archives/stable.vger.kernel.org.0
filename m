Hi Roberto,

Thank you for updating the patch description.

Assuming that the EVM HMAC key is stored in the initramfs, not on some
other file system, and the initramfs is signed, INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN
would be limited to the rootfs filesystem.

This patch defines a global policy requiring EVM on all filesystems.
I've previously suggested extending the IMA policy to support
enforcing or maybe exempting EVM on a per IMA policy rule basis. Â As
seen by the need for an additional patch, included in this patch set,
which defines a temporary random number HMAC key to address
INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN on the rootfs filesystem, exempting certain
filesystems on a per policy rule basis might be simpler and achieve
similar results.

I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on defining a temporary,
random number HMAC key.

thanks,

Mimi
