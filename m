Hello Dear Friend,

will be a great surprise to you reading this message from me today.
But I want you to consider this as God divine intervention and
opportunity which I believed that You and I can cooperate together in
this humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the merciful
compassionate.

tumor disease and this illness has gotten to a very bad stage, without
any family members and no child. I hoped that you will not expose or
betray this trust and confident that I am about to entrust on you for
the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileges ones. I have
some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of ($
8.450.000.00 Eight Million Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars)
deposited with the Bank. Haven=E2=80=99t   known my present health conditio=
n,
I decided to entrust this fund under your custody believing that you
will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein, for orphanages
and gives justice and help to the poor, needy, elderly ones, disables
and to promote the words of God and the effort that the house of God
will be maintained.
My dear, all I need and required from you is your sincerity and
ability to carry out the transaction and fulfill my final wish in
implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that the bank
has finally release and transfer the fund into your bank account in
your country even before I die here in the hospital, because my
present health condition is very critical at the moment everything
need to be process rapidly as soon as possible.
Meanwhile It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment
Manager/Partner with 30% percent of the total money for your effort in
handling the transaction while 70% of the money will be Invested into
the charity project there in your country. Meanwhile I am waiting for
