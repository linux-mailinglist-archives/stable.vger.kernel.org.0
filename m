Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker. Top-posting for once,
to make this easily accessible to everyone.

FYI: looks like this isn't a regression, as Stephane mentioned in a
comment to the bko report:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215660#c13

> So today i could reproduce on 5.10.46 after a few days of testing. It does not look like a regression.

Thus removing it from the regression tracking:

#regzbot invalid: After further testing it does not look like a
regression anymore

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
