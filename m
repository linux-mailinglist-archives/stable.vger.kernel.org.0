My dearest,

I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.
With due respect, trust and humanity, i appeal to you to exercise a
little patience and read through my letter i feel quite safe dealing
with you in this important business having gone through your
remarkable profile, honestly i am writing this email to you with
pains, tears and sorrow from my heart, i will really like to have good
relationship with you and i have a special reason why I decided to
contact you. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of my
situation.

My name is Miss. Riahnna Kipkalya, 19yrs old female and i am from
Kenya in East Africa. Light in complexion, single (never married) but
presently i am residing here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso refugee
camp. My father Late Dr. Kipkalya Kones was the former Kenyan road
Minister. He and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had
been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho and crashed
in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya. The plane crashed
on the Tuesday 10th, June, 2008. You can read more about the crash
through the below site:
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html?iref=
=3Dnextin

After the burial of my father, my Father Brothers conspired and sold
my father' s property to an Italian Expatriate which they shared the
money among themselves and left nothing for me. One faithful morning I
opened my father's briefcase and found out the documents which he have
deposited huge amount of money to the tune of us$18.7 million with 150
kilogram of gold dust in one bank in Burkina Faso with my name as the
next of kin.

I have informed the bank about claiming this deposit and the only
thing they told me is that I am still underage to claim the deposit. I
told them that I have already contacted my father=E2=80=99s foreign partner
who will assist me in the transfer. My mind told me that you are the
honest and reliable person who will help me and stand as my trustee so
that I will present you to the Bank for transferring of my father=E2=80=99s
gold and money to your bank account in overseas. I have chosen to
contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my
trust. But rather take me as your own biological sister or daughter
which I will be coming to your country as soon as this money and gold
is transferred to you.

My dearest, things are very bad for me here in the refugee camp, Even
one of us died last night and was buried this morning. I am afraid of
what i am seeing here. I don't know who it will be her turn tomorrow;
I was planning to read law in my life before the ugly incident that
killed my parents that put me in this horrible place i found myself
today. This place is like a prison as we are only allowed to go out on
Monday and Friday of the week as given by the united nation rules and
regulation here in Burkina Faso.I hope by Gods grace I will come out
here soon.

I don' t have any relatives now whom i can go to and the only person I
have now is Rev. Isaac Ambrose who is the reverend father of the
Catholic church here in the refugee camp, he has been very nice to me
since i came here but i am not living with him rather i am leaving in
the women's hostel because the refugee have two hostels one for men
the other for women, Please if you want to help me out of this
situation respond back so that I will tell you more about me.


Thanks.
Miss. Riahnna Kipkalya
