My Dear Friend,

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is
not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must ,
come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that
people meet and become great friends and business partners.

Please I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must
apologize for barging this message into your mail box without any
formal introduction due to the urgency and confidentiality of this
business and I know that this message will come to you as a surprise.

 Please, this is not a joke and I will not like you to joke with it
OK, With due respect to your person and much sincerity of purpose, I
make this contact with you as I believe that you can be of great
assistance, to me. My name is Dr.Jaslin Ikhsan, from Burkina Faso,
West Africa. I work in Bank here as telex manager, please see this
as a confidential message and do  not reveal it to another person, and
let me know whether you can be of assistance regarding my proposal
below because it is top secret.

I am about to retire from active Banking service to start a new life ,
but I am skeptical to reveal this particular secret to a stranger.
You must assure me that everything will be handled confidentially
because we are not going to suffer again in life. It has been 10 years
now that most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to
launder,  money overseas through the help of their Political advisers.

Most of the funds which they transferred out of the shores of Africa were gold
and oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the
continent. Their Political advisers always inflated the amounts before
transferring to foreign accounts,  so I also used the opportunity to
divert part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official
trace of how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such
transfers were being closed after transfer.

I acted as the Bank Officer to most of the politicians and when I
discovered that they were using me to succeed in their greedy act;  I
also cleaned some of their banking records from the Bank files and no
one cared to ask me because the money was too much for them to
control,  They laundered over $5billion Dollars during the process.
Before I send this message to you,  I have already diverted
($10.5million Dollars) to an escrow account belonging to no one in the
bank.

The bank is anxious now to know who the beneficiary to the funds is
because they have made a lot of profits with the funds. It is more
than Eight years now and most of the politicians are no longer using
our bank to transfer funds overseas. The ($10.5million Dollars) has
been laying waste in our bank and I don't want to retire from the bank
without transferring the funds to a foreign account to enable me share
the proceeds with the receiver (a foreigner).

The money will be shared 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no one
coming to ask you about the funds because I secured everything. I only
want you to assist me by providing a reliable bank account where the
funds can be transferred. You are not to face any difficulties or
legal implications as I am going to handle the transfer personally. If
you are capable of receiving the funds,  do let me know immediately to
enable me give you a detailed information on what to do.

For me,  I have not stolen the money from anyone because the other
people that took the whole money did not face any problems.  This is
my chance to grab my own life opportunity but you must keep the
details of the funds secret to avoid any leakages as no one in the
bank knows about my plans.

  Please get back to me if you are interested and capable to handle
this project,  I shall intimate you on what to do when I hear from
your confirmation and acceptance. If you are capable of being my
trusted associate,do declare your consent to me, I am looking forward
to hear from you immediately for further information,

Thanks with my best regards.
Dr.Jaslin Ikhsan,
Bank Telex Manager
Burkina Faso/Ouagadougou
