Yup. I've been thinking somewhat what I could or should do to ensure
things work more smoothly when similar situations arise in the future;
ideally without me stepping on maintainer's toes too much. ;)

Currently I consider doing the following two things:

(1) if I notice something that looks like an important regression fix,
reply with a "how fast do you think this fix should process through the
ranks" inquiry to the developer. With such information I'd feel way more
comfortable sending a "Linus, could you maybe pick this up directly"
after some time in case the maintainer leaves the patch longer in -next.

(2) once Linus merged the fix, send a quick mail to Greg/the stable team
asking them to immediately queue it for the next release (in case
problems show up it can still be de-queued).

Does that sound sane? Or anyone any better idea?

Ciao, Thorsten
