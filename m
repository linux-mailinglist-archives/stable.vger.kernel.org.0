Attention: Please,

I am John Robinson, the Head of file Department in Tesco Bank Plc here
in London United Kingdom. I wish to notify you again that you were
listed as a beneficiary to the total sum of Twelve Million Five
Hundred thousand British pounds in the codicil and last testament of
our deceased customer Late (NAME WITHHELD). I contacted you because
you bear the same surname identity and therefore I can present you as
the beneficiary to the inheritance.

I therefore reckoned that you can receive these funds as you are
qualified by your name identity. I shall provide you with the legal
papers in my possession that you will present to our bank as prove of
your claim for immediate processing of the fund release to you, in
your acceptance to co-operate with me on this deal.

Kindly forward to me your letter of acceptance; your current telephone
and fax numbers and a forwarding address to enable me file in an
application of claim with our bank on your behalf.

Yours Faithfully,
Head of file Department,
John Robinson.
Tel: +44793743516.
