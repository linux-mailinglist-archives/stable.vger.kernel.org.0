[ Upstream commit c986a7024916c92a775fc8d853fba3cae1d5fde4 ]

The Thinkpad Yoga 11e 4th gen with the N3450 / Celeron CPU only has
one battery which is named BAT1 instead of the expected BAT0, add a
quirk for this. This fixes not being able to set the charging tresholds
on this model; and this alsoe fixes the following errors in dmesg:

ACPI: \_SB_.PCI0.LPCB.EC__.HKEY: BCTG evaluated but flagged as error
thinkpad_acpi: Error probing battery 2
battery: extension failed to load: ThinkPad Battery Extension
battery: extension unregistered: ThinkPad Battery Extension

Note that the added quirk is for the "R0K" BIOS versions which are
used on the Thinkpad Yoga 11e 4th gen's with a Celeron CPU, there
is a separate "R0L" BIOS for the i3/i5 based versions. This may also
need the same quirk, but if that really is necessary is unknown.
