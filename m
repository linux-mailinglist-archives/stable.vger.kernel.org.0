Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

Great to see that you quickly picked up this patch. Once the new stable
and longterm releases are out on Wednesday, it will fix a regression
that made it into many stable and longterm kernels nearly four weeks
earlier. I tracked the issue, which made me we wonder: should I have
done something differently in this case to get the regression resolved
more quickly? Should I maybe have suggested to remove the culprit
temporarily until the fix was merged to mainline?

For context, this is the story of the regression afaics: the change
ab07506b0454 ("iwlwifi: fix leaks/bad data after failed firmware load")
was merged for 5.17-rc1 (released on 2022-01-23). Shortly after it was
backported to several stable/longterm series with new versions released
on 2022-01-27. It triggered a general protection fault, if the proper
firmware file was missing. Afaics at least five people reported the
problem between 2022-02-01 and 2022-02-11 for at least 5.10.y, 5.15.y
and 5.16.y (some of those reports were on the stable list), which shows
that such a setup is not that unusual. A fix was posted on 2022-02-08
and approved and committed by a maintainer on 2022-02-10. It was then
merged to mainline on 2022-02-17 (I hope we can find ways to reduce such
particular timeframes in the future, but that's a different story). Now
that rc5 is out the fix is on track for integration into new stable and
longterm releases due soon -- in the end about four weeks after the
regression was introduced and a bit more than three after it was
reported to the stable list.

Ciao, Thorsten
