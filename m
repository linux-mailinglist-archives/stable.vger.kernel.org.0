Good Day Friend;

My name is Dr. Mark Donald, A banker by Profession and Currently A
Director of Finance Auditing and Accounting Unit in my Bank, Which the
name will giving to you as soon as you respond for security reason. I
got your email address in my search for a reputable and reliable
person to help me claim the sum of Fifteen Million Six Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars ($15,600,000.00) Deposited in our Bank
by one of our customer Engr. Christopher Mueller who died with his
wife and two children on the 21st day of April 2010 in car clash.

Since his death no one has come up as his NEXT OF KIN and all our
efforts to locate any member of his family, relative or friend that
was why I decided to see if I can get anybody who has the same
surname, middle name or last name with him via internet preferably
some one of the same nationality with him which I believe you have all
the qualities we need. Why I am contacting you is to present you to
our bank as the NEXT OF KIN to the deceased customer. He was Drilling
contractor with some Oil Companies here. So it will be more acceptable
and wiser to present you through paper work to the Bank for claim of
the total fund.

I will give you all the necessary requirements that the bank may
request from you and follow up the transfer of the fund into your
account as an Insider. It will interest you to know that I as his
account officer, I have been keeping the account dormant to enable my
plan for the funds to come through and this is the time and I'm happy
to locate you for the perfection of the transfer of the Fund into your
nominated Bank Account to be given.

As soon as I get your positive response I will update you about the
mode of disbursement and I will also need to know about investing in
your Country as a way of helping your people who suppose are the
original owner's of this Fund, I suggest you get back to me as soon as
possible.

Yours Sincerely,
Dr. Mark Donald,
