Hello Dear God,s Select Good Day,

I apologized, If this mail find's you disturbing, It might not be the
best way to approach you as we have not met before, but due to the
urgency of my present situation i decided  to communicate this way, so
please pardon my manna, I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears
In my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, My Name is Mrs.Juliette
Morgan, and I am contacting you from my country Norway, I want to tell
you this because I don't have any other option than to tell you as I
was touched to open up to you,

I married to Mr.sami Morgan. Who worked with Norway embassy in Burkina
Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2011.We were married
for eleven years without a child He died after a brief illness that
lasted for only five days. Since his death I decided not to remarry,
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 8.5 Millio=
n
Euro (Eight million, Five hundred thousand Euros) in a bank in
Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso in west Africa Presently
this money is still in bank. He made this money available for
exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining.

Recently, My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of
seven months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is
my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to hand you
over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will
utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

I want you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use
While 70% of the money will go to charity, people in the street and
helping the orphanage. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have any
body as my family member, just to endeavour that the house of God is
maintained. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and accept
my soul because these sicknesses have suffered me so much.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
bank in Burkina Faso and I will also instruct the Bank Manager to
issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present
beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you
will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

Always reply to my alternative for security purposes

Hoping to receive your reply:
From Mrs.Juliette Morgan,
