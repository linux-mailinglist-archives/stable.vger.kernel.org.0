This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    iio: buffer: align the size of scan bytes to size of the largest

to my staging git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git
in the staging-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: iio: buffer: align the size of scan bytes to size of the largest
 element
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Previous versions of `iio_compute_scan_bytes` only aligned each element
to its own length (i.e. its own natural alignment). Because multiple
consecutive sets of scan elements are buffered this does not work in
case the computed scan bytes do not align with the natural alignment of
the first scan element in the set.

This commit fixes this by aligning the scan bytes to the natural
alignment of the largest scan element in the set.
