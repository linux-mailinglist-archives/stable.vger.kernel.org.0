I am Mr.Edward,i work as an accountant in a bank, i need your urgent
co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my bank,from my
section in the bank i discovered an abandoned sum of $11.6million
dollars that belongs to one of our foreign customer.Who died with his
supposed next of kin since July 22, 2003 in plane crash.The money has
been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody
coming for the claim of it. I need your urgent assistance in
transferring the fund into your private bank account.

I want the bank to release the money to you as the relative and the
next of kin to our deceased customer,the Banking laws here does not
allow such money to stay more than 19years,because the money will be
recalled to the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.I am ready to
share with you 40% for you and 60% will be kept for me, by indicating
your interest i will send you the full details on how the transfer
will be executed and delete if you are not interested.
