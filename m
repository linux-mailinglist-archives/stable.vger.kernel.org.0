We should probably make it signed in the future when used.
It should never hit the LONG_MAX limit, since max value returned would be ULONG_MAX >> PAGE_SHIFT,
assuming the entire address space is filled with evictable buffers.

I've kept the ww lock, in case we want to evict in the future. Without ww context the buffers
are trylocked, with ww we can evict the entire address space as much as possible.
In most cases we only want to evict idle objects, in that case no ww is needed.

Pushed just this patch, thanks for feedback. :)
