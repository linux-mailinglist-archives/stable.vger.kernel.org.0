What issue is that?  Your url is wrapped and can not work here :(

Is this a regression or support for something new that has never worked
before?

Do all of the above patches apply cleanly?  Do they need to be
backported?  Have you tested that?  Do you have such a series of patches
so we can compare them?

The patch below is not in any format that I can take it in.  ALso, 95%
of the times we take a patch that is different from what is upstream
will have bugs and problems over time because of that.  So I always want
to take the original upstream patches instead if at all possible.

So I need a lot more information here in order to try to determine this,
sorry.

thanks,
