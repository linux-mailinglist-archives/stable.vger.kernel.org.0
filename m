This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    iio: buffer: make sure O_NONBLOCK is respected

to my char-misc git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc.git
in the char-misc-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

For output buffers, there's no guarantee that the buffer won't be full
in the first iteration of the loop in which case we would block
independently of userspace passing O_NONBLOCK or not. Fix it by always
checking the flag before going to sleep.

While at it (and as it's a bit related), refactored the loop so that the
stop condition is 'written != n', i.e, run the loop until all data has
been copied into the IIO buffers. This makes the code a bit simpler.
