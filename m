My Good Friend,

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this mail is not
a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it seriously. This mail must come
to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people
meet and become great friends and business partners. Please I want you
to read this mail very carefully and I must apologize for barging this
message into your mail box without any formal introduction due to the
urgency and confidentiality of this business and I know that this
message willcome to you as a surprise. Please this is not a joke and I
will notlike you to joke with it ok, with due respect to your person
and much
sincerity of purpose, I make this contact with you as I believe that
you can be of great assistance to me. My name is Mr. Roman Arkadyevich
Abramovich (born 24 October 1966)I am  a billionaire Russian oligarch
and politician. I hold joint Israeli and Portuguese citizenships.
Please see this as a confidential message and do not reveal it to
another person and let me know whether you can be of assistance
regarding my proposal below because it is top secret.


 I am  one of seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government over the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine which i never supported, including
asset freezes and travel bans. But now as all my acounts and valuable
assets have been frozen and conphisicated. There is this very account
i opened without my identity and now i cannot claim it with my name
and identity because it was opened in an escrow account  in a bank in
Africa when i was scouting for good african players to play for my
club Chelsea,the funds in the bank is (=C2=A3250,000,000 million British
Pounds)two hundred and fiffty million British pounds.This is where you
come in now as the beneficiary of the said fund because i left the
space of the beneficiary open for me to claim the funds back through a
trusted beneficiary like you.

Please if you can stand and transfer this fund to your designated
account as the beneficiary i will back you up with the neccessary
information that you will need. I want you to know that this is a
hundrd percent risk free transaction if you follow my instructions
there will be no mistakes.Once the fund is transferred into your
account please take only (=C2=A350,000,000 million Pounds) and keep the
rest (=C2=A3200,000,000 million Pounds) for me. i will inform you in my
next mail on how to invest the money in your own country.

If you are willing to assist me on this i will feed you with more details.


sincerely,
Mr.R.Abramovich.
