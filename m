Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org that afaics nobody
acted upon since it was reported more than ten days ago (it afaifcs only
later became clear this is a regression), that's why I decided to
forward it to the lists and a few relevant people to the CC. To quote
from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215660:

> Created attachment 300529 [details]
> lspci and ethtool outputs on reproducing systems
> 
> Context:
> - dense enterprise deployment, 10 lightweight aps (Aruba) on one office floor, up to 125 concurrent users total, up to 25 user per AP
> - the wireless network supports 802.11n, 802.11ac and 802.11ax in 5 GHz band
> - authentication is wpa2-psk
> - client devices consists in a variety of endpoints (laptops, cell phones, tablets, smart devices), running various versions of Mac OSX, Linux, Windows, Android or IOS.
> - certain clients supports only 20Mhz, HT protection kicks in and turns off on APs as those clients are moving around. Consequently ht_operation_mode fluctuates between 4 and 6 even when staying on the same AP.
> - the issue affects various laptops with Intel AX200 or AX201 chipsets, running Debian or Ubuntu with a recent kernel >= 5.10
> - see attached file devices.txt for detailed information on the different laptops we have reproduced the issue on
> 
> 
> Steps to reproduce:
> - appears sometimes, but not always, after the iwlwifi STA roams from one AP to another
> - seen more often when ht_operation_mode changes between 4 and 6 (but not sufficient to trigger the issue)
> - STA deassociates from current AP and associates to the new one successfully
> - connectivity works on the new AP for a short period of time, usually between 30s and 1 minute
> - then suddenly, the Rx path breaks. No more received frame visible on the STA wireless interface. AP reports that frames are retransmitted and not acknowledged by STA.
> - the Tx path keeps working. Frames sent by STA to AP are received and visible on the network
> - in this state each inbound frame appears to trigger iwl_pcie_rx_handle_rb with cmd BAR_FRAME_RELEASE (seqnum is always the same):

Could somebody take a look into this? Or was this discussed somewhere
else already? Or even fixed?

Anyway, to get this tracked:

#regzbot introduced: 608c8359c567b4a04dedbe
#regzbot from: Stephane Poignant <stephane.poignant@proton.ch>
#regzbot title: wireless: iwlwifi: regression in 5.10.67 due to
"iwlwifi: pcie: free RBs during configure"

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.

Additional information about regzbot:

If you want to know more about regzbot, check out its web-interface, the
getting start guide, and the references documentation:

https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/
https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot/-/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md
https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot/-/blob/main/docs/reference.md

The last two documents will explain how you can interact with regzbot
yourself if your want to.

Hint for reporters: when reporting a regression it's in your interest to
CC the regression list and tell regzbot about the issue, as that ensures
the regression makes it onto the radar of the Linux kernel's regression
tracker -- that's in your interest, as it ensures your report won't fall
through the cracks unnoticed.

Hint for developers: you normally don't need to care about regzbot once
it's involved. Fix the issue as you normally would, just remember to
include 'Link:' tag in the patch descriptions pointing to all reports
about the issue. This has been expected from developers even before
regzbot showed up for reasons explained in
'Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst' and
'Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst'.
