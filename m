------------------

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

commit cee7fb437edcdb2f9f8affa959e274997f5dca4d upstream.

set_page_dirty says:

	For pages with a mapping this should be done under the page lock
	for the benefit of asynchronous memory errors who prefer a
	consistent dirty state. This rule can be broken in some special
	cases, but should be better not to.

Under those rules, it is only safe for us to use the plain set_page_dirty
calls for shmemfs/anonymous memory. Userptr may be used with real
mappings and so needs to use the locked version (set_page_dirty_lock).

However, following a try_to_unmap() we may want to remove the userptr and
so call put_pages(). However, try_to_unmap() acquires the page lock and
so we must avoid recursively locking the pages ourselves -- which means
that we cannot safely acquire the lock around set_page_dirty(). Since we
can't be sure of the lock, we have to risk skip dirtying the page, or
else risk calling set_page_dirty() without a lock and so risk fs
corruption.
