Hello,

I am writing to you on behalf of Mr. Yusuf Habib. My name is Lukas, I am an investment portfolio Manager at MetLife, and my client (Mr. Yusuf Habib) has a large sum of money he is looking for someone to help him manage the funds.The Saudi government filed charges against my-client Mr. Yusuf Habib with the aim of keeping him in prison indefinitely. A variety of local and foreign politicians, civil activists, and journalists consider the process leading to the imprisonment of Mr. Yusuf to be politically motivated. 

My client's involvement and financial support for Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi posed the most challenge ever to Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud who happens to be the current Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia the money is currently deposited in the name of an existing Investment entity.

My client Mr. Yusuf Habib has presented a subtle offer that will need the help of a partner like you to complete successfully. Mr. Yusuf Habib is in a difficult situation, and he must immediately relocate certain sums of money and this must be done in such a way that it must not be tied to Mr. Yusuf Habib. The money is currently deposited in the name of an existing Investment entity. Your role will be to:

[1]. Act as the original beneficiary of the funds.
[2]. Receive the funds into a business / private bank account.
[3]. Invest / Manage the funds outside of Turkey
[4]. Value of funds: 35 million US Dollars.


Everything will be done legally to ensure the rights to the funds are transferred to you. If you agree to partner with Mr. Yusuf Habib in this partnership business proposal, he will compensate you with 35% percent of the total sum. Terms will be discussed when you show interest and if you aren't interested and you know of someone looking for an investor, please give him / her my contact.

Should you prefer I re-contact you with more express facts. Then make your interest known.

Sincerely,
Lukas.
