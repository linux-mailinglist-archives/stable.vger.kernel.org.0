stage in that transaction by then is very much happy to inform you
about my success in getting the fund moved to Iran under the
assistance, and co-operation of a new partner from Iran. Presently, I
am in Germany for investment projects with my share of the total sum.

Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts, and attempts to assist
me on the moving of the fund, and I makes sure that you aren't left
