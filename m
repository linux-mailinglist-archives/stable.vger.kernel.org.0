Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso together with my later
husband that once a Gold seller and owner of Mecey Gold Mine Company,
please i do not have formal relationship with you but because of my
present predicament and circumstances i am made to contact you.i have
been suffering from throat cancer terminally ill and have a short life
to leave because my family doctor make me to understand that i am
condemned to certain death.i have made up my mind to donate my
inheritance of $10.5million dollars to take care of the less
privileged because it's my plan to help less privileged with this
Fund,  please help me to fulfill my last wish.

You we take 35 Percent of the total money for your personal use While
65 Percent of the money is to bulld less privileged organazition and
helping the orphanage. Because i myself grew up as an Orphan and I
don't have anybody as my family member. I will also instruct the Bank
Manger to issue you an authority letter that will prove you the
present beneficiary of the money in the bank that if you assure me
that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.

Your early reply is highly welcomed.
