After mulling this over for a while, I think the TIF flag's existence is
fine, but the APIs are all awful.  I think we should give the states in
the little FPU state machine explicit names:

ACTIVE: If the current CPU's FPU regs are ACTIVE, then those regs are
the current task's registers and current->fpu does not necessarily
contain the current task's registers.  (This is !TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD.)

INACTIVE: If the current CPU's FPU regs are INACTIVE, then those regs
belong to the kernel and do not belong to any particular task.  The
current task's FPU registers are in current->fpu.

PRESERVED: If the current CPU's FPU regs are PRESERVED for a given task,
then they are guaranteed to match that task's task->fpu.  It is possible
to tell whether a given task's FPU regs are PRESERVED on a given CPU,
but it is not possible to tell whether a given CPU's regs are PRESERVED
or INACTIVE, as it is possible that fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx points to
memory that has been reused for a different purpose, so dereferencing
->last_fpu is not safe.


If a non-current task is running, then its FPU state may not be accessed
(obviously).  Similarly, in interrupt context, neither FPU regs nor
current->fpu may be accessed, as interrupts can nest inside
fpregs_lock()ed regions and the state may be indeterminate.

If a non-current task is *stopped*, then its FPU registers may be read.
If its FPU registers are invalidated, then they may also be written.
fpu__prepare_read() and fpu__prepare_write() may be used for these
purposes.  (But fpu__prepare_read() should be rewritten.  It currently
copies the regs to memory but leaves the state ACTIVE, which is just
silly, especially the absurd way it manages the FSAVE clobber
workaround.  It should just do switch_fpu_prepare().)



And we add some APIs that have locking assertions:

fpu__current_regs_active(): returns true if the current task's regs are
ACTIVE.  This replaces most checks for TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD.  Asserts
!preemptible().

and more to come, but not today.
