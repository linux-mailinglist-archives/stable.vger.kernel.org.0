[ Upstream commit 4475f8c4ab7b248991a60d9c02808dbb813d6be8 ]

A previous fix to the stop handling on compressed capture streams causes
some knock on issues. The previous fix updated snd_compr_drain_notify to
set the state back to PREPARED for capture streams. This causes some
issues however as the handling for snd_compr_poll differs between the
two states and some user-space applications were relying on the poll
failing after the stream had been stopped.

To correct this regression whilst still fixing the original problem the
patch was addressing, update the capture handling to skip the PREPARED
state rather than skipping the SETUP state as it has done until now.
