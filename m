commit 1b5a42d9c85f0e731f01c8d1129001fd8531a8a0 upstream.

In the function bacct_add_task the code reading task->exit_code was
introduced in commit f3cef7a99469 ("[PATCH] csa: basic accounting over
taskstats"), and it is not entirely clear what the taskstats interface
is trying to return as only returning the exit_code of the first task
in a process doesn't make a lot of sense.

As best as I can figure the intent is to return task->exit_code after
a task exits.  The field is returned with per task fields, so the
exit_code of the entire process is not wanted.  Only the value of the
first task is returned so this is not a useful way to get the per task
ptrace stop code.  The ordinary case of returning this value is
returning after a task exits, which also precludes use for getting
a ptrace value.

It is common to for the first task of a process to also be the last
task of a process so this field may have done something reasonable by
accident in testing.

Make ac_exitcode a reliable per task value by always returning it for
every exited task.

Setting ac_exitcode in a sensible mannter makes it possible to continue
to provide this value going forward.
