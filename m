Hello,

I have received your contact details through online searching as a
good match for future business that will make both of us very happy!
Allow me to introduce  myself properly, my name is Mrs Sanou Rose, I
am currently the regional manager of BIB Bank Burkina Faso. Although I
am American by birth, I have been based here in Burkina for almost 14
years now!

I understand that this message must seem quite strange but I assure
you, if my sources are correct, together we will be able to ensure the
success of my proposal.

As the Regional Bank Manager, it is part of my job to send financial
reports to my head office Burkina, over the course of 2017 =E2=80=93 2018 I
was looking at the years  fiscal report=E2=80=99s and I discovered that the
branch that I am managing has funds that are not accounted for
according to my head office. I have taken certain steps to  make sure
that these funds will also go undetected on all accounts. I have set
this up so it will be risk free and like I said, if my sources are
correct about you, everything will go perfectly.

Currently the funds are in =E2=80=9Cescrow=E2=80=9D without a beneficiary, =
basically
put, the account is waiting for me to add a beneficiary to the account
to allow the funds to be transferred as soon as our =E2=80=9Cwork=E2=80=9D =
is
complete!

As I am sure you are aware, I cannot be seen to be connected directly
to these funds, that would cause too many issues and risks for myself,
hence why I am contacting you. As long as I have a third party (you)
that I would be able to add as a beneficiary, we have open and clear
communication together, both of us will be able to walk

away more than happy and both with a new friend for life, I am sure!

I am in contact with several other potential prospects that my sources
have informed me would also be a successful match, so a quick response
would be in your best interest if you would like to proceed and
receive further details.

If you are interested to hear more details, please fill in the
information below:

First Name

Last Name

Phone Number

Email


I will use these details as an initial confirmation, if several of my
prospects shall send me a response, I will slowly narrow down the
process to find the best option possible to complete the transactions.

I appreciate your timely response and I look forward to being in
further contact with you along our venture.

Have a great day!

Best Regards,

Mrs Sanou Rose
