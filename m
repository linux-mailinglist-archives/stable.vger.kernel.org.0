Dear
I am Mrs. Wendy Adams a widow , I am looking for a good and reliable
person who will not betray me or bring more pain to me, but help and
brings me out of this wicked country.
I and my late Husband came back home last year 2020 from UK because of
his health condition, Four months later my late husband died of High
Blood Pressure.
Before his death he sold our houses with other landed properties and
deposited the money in a bank here, which he wanted to use and start a
Hotel business as soon as he get better.
Now his brothers and families has been fighting me and also trying to
claim the fund for themselves because I do not have a child.
If you can help me receive this fund into your Bank account and bring
me to start a new life there in your country.  I am ready to abide by
your terms and condition provided you will be honest to me.
I wait to hear from you.
Mrs.Wendy.
