There's at least one such case: see chain_epi_lockless() updating
epi->next, called from ep_poll_callback() with a read_lock held. This
races with ep_done_scan() which has the write_lock held.

I think the authors of the above code interpreted the read_lock as
something that multiple threads can own disregarding the _read_ part.
