commit 6ce64428d62026a10cb5d80138ff2f90cc21d367 upstream.

Userfaultfd self-test fails occasionally, indicating a memory corruption.

Analyzing this problem indicates that there is a real bug since mmap_lock
is only taken for read in mwriteprotect_range() and defers flushes, and
since there is insufficient consideration of concurrent deferred TLB
flushes in wp_page_copy().  Although the PTE is flushed from the TLBs in
wp_page_copy(), this flush takes place after the copy has already been
performed, and therefore changes of the page are possible between the time
of the copy and the time in which the PTE is flushed.

To make matters worse, memory-unprotection using userfaultfd also poses a
problem.  Although memory unprotection is logically a promotion of PTE
permissions, and therefore should not require a TLB flush, the current
userrfaultfd code might actually cause a demotion of the architectural PTE
permission: when userfaultfd_writeprotect() unprotects memory region, it
unintentionally *clears* the RW-bit if it was already set.  Note that this
unprotecting a PTE that is not write-protected is a valid use-case: the
userfaultfd monitor might ask to unprotect a region that holds both
write-protected and write-unprotected PTEs.

The scenario that happens in selftests/vm/userfaultfd is as follows:

cpu0				cpu1			cpu2
----				----			----
							[ Writable PTE
							  cached in TLB ]
userfaultfd_writeprotect()
[ write-*unprotect* ]
mwriteprotect_range()
mmap_read_lock()
change_protection()

change_protection_range()
...
change_pte_range()
[ *clear* “write”-bit ]
[ defer TLB flushes ]
				[ page-fault ]
				...
				wp_page_copy()
				 cow_user_page()
				  [ copy page ]
							[ write to old
							  page ]
				...
				 set_pte_at_notify()

A similar scenario can happen:

cpu0		cpu1		cpu2		cpu3
----		----		----		----
						[ Writable PTE
				  		  cached in TLB ]
userfaultfd_writeprotect()
[ write-protect ]
[ deferred TLB flush ]
		userfaultfd_writeprotect()
		[ write-unprotect ]
		[ deferred TLB flush]
				[ page-fault ]
				wp_page_copy()
				 cow_user_page()
				 [ copy page ]
				 ...		[ write to page ]
				set_pte_at_notify()

This race exists since commit 292924b26024 ("userfaultfd: wp: apply
_PAGE_UFFD_WP bit").  Yet, as Yu Zhao pointed, these races became apparent
since commit 09854ba94c6a ("mm: do_wp_page() simplification") which made
wp_page_copy() more likely to take place, specifically if page_count(page)
> 1.

To resolve the aforementioned races, check whether there are pending
flushes on uffd-write-protected VMAs, and if there are, perform a flush
before doing the COW.

Further optimizations will follow to avoid during uffd-write-unprotect
unnecassary PTE write-protection and TLB flushes.
