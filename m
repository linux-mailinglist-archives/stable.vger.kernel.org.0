[ Upstream commit 2863dd2db23e0407f6c50b8ba5c0e55abef894f1 ]

When CONFIG_GENERIC_CPU=y (true for all our defconfigs) we pass
-mcpu=powerpc64 to the compiler, even when we're building a 32-bit
kernel.

This happens because we have an ifdef CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_64/else block in
the Makefile that was written before 32-bit supported GENERIC_CPU. Prior
to that the else block only applied to 64-bit Book3E.

The GCC man page says -mcpu=powerpc64 "[specifies] a pure ... 64-bit big
endian PowerPC ... architecture machine [type], with an appropriate,
generic processor model assumed for scheduling purposes."

It's unclear how that interacts with -m32, which we are also passing,
although obviously -m32 is taking precedence in some sense, as the
32-bit kernel only contains 32-bit instructions.

This was noticed by inspection, not via any bug reports, but it does
affect code generation. Comparing before/after code generation, there
are some changes to instruction scheduling, and the after case (with
-mcpu=powerpc64 removed) the compiler seems more keen to use r8.

Fix it by making the else case only apply to Book3E 64, which excludes
32-bit.
