My dear friend,
How are you and your family i hope everything is well.

I write to inform you that i have finally succeeded in getting those
funds transferred into one of my friend's bank account in Brasil. So
i'm in Brasil for two years now to extablish a business as i told you
before.

But i didn't forget your passed effort to help me, though your efforts
to help me receive those funds did not work out as we planned it. But
i can not forget you, that is the reason why i offered you this Cheque
to let you know that i still have you in mind, this is a Cheque of
$3,000.000.00 u.s.d. You should contact my secretary PRIEST JOHNSON
HEMMENS in Burkina Faso, West Africa to send the Cheque to you.  This
is his email address ( priestjohnsonhemmens@priest.com )  and his
telephone number ( +226-54798341 )

This sum of $3,000.000.00 u.s.d, i gave to you is 5 percents of my own
share after sharing the total funds with that my friend in Brasil.
After receiving the your Cheque let me know so that we can celebrate
together. But for now i am very busy and i will not be checking my
mail always because of the project i have at hand now.

You remain my good friend.
