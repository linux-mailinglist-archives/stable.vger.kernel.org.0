Indeed. I've updated the commit message in v2 to explain what goes
wrong (your analysis was spot on, but a mailing list message is more
ephermal than a commit message). I'll send out v2 tomorrow assuming
nobody objects to v1 in the mean time.

Thanks for the review.

Oh, I missed this one. Guess we have 4 bugs with this code instead of
just 3, yikes. How could such a short function be so deeply and horribly
broken? ðŸ˜ƒ

Should I add a fourth patch to the series to fix this?
