Dear friend,

may God bless you, please Can you join me and help people?

It's my pleasure to have contact with you, based on the critical
condition I find myself and my desire to will part of my property to
the Orphans, Disable, blind, Old and poor people who have nothing to
eat, although, it's not financial problem is about my health, you
might have know that cancer is not what to talk  about at home I have
been in the hospital for 7 months now I am Mrs. Rose Banneth and I am
married to Mr. Abaulkarim banneth who worked with Tun norway embassy
here in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year
February 2011.We were married for eleven years without a child. He
died after a brief illness that lasted for five days.

Since the death of my husband I have been dying and diagnosed with
cancer for 4 years now, I decided not to remarry. When my late husband
was alive he deposited the sum of (=E2=82=AC8.5 Million Euro)  (Eight milli=
on,
Five hundred thousand Euros) in a bank in Burkina Faso for me,
presently this money is still in bank. I want you to help me use this
money for the poor people around you in your Country it is the
Almighty God direction that I choose you to do this with your heart.

My Doctors told me that I don't have much time to live because of the
cancer problem and i don t want to live this money in the bank for
Government instead I decided to use it for Old people who cannot work
again and Orphans who have nothing to eat because i am Orphan, Having
known my condition I decided to hand over this fund to a responsible
person that have fear of God to receive this money and use it for the
needy instead of this money be forgotten to the bank. Can you have the
time to do this? If so please, i want you to contact me here my
private email address mrsrosebanneth19@gmail.com  to know on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account or online banking.

I wait for your response.
My regards,
Mrs Rose Banneth
