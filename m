Hello dear friend,
How is life and everything around you over there in your location,
I hope you and all the rest of your family members are safe from
This pandemic period? though some countries have started their
official and commercial activities

i know that you will be surprised to receive mail from me since we do not know
Each other before, kindly accept my humble apology, email is one of
the means of relating with each other to explain our challenges with
one other okay


i urgently need your advice your suggestion and also your moral
support over my private issue, but the only thing
That will enable me to  explain more better for you regarding this my
private issue is only when you respond back to me positive

Thank you.
