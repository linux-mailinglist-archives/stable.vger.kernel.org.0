From: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com>

commit 00289cd87676e14913d2d8492d1ce05c4baafdae upstream.

The libnvdimm subsystem arranges for devices to be destroyed as a result
of a sysfs operation. Since device_unregister() cannot be called from
an actively running sysfs attribute of the same device libnvdimm
arranges for device_unregister() to be performed in an out-of-line async
context.

The driver core maintains a 'dead' state for coordinating its own racing
async registration / de-registration requests. Rather than add local
'dead' state tracking infrastructure to libnvdimm device objects, export
the existing state tracking via a new kill_device() helper.

The kill_device() helper simply marks the device as dead, i.e. that it
is on its way to device_del(), or returns that the device was already
dead. This can be used in advance of calling device_unregister() for
subsystems like libnvdimm that might need to handle multiple user
threads racing to delete a device.

This refactoring does not change any behavior, but it is a pre-requisite
for follow-on fixes and therefore marked for -stable.
