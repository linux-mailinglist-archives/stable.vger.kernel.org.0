ASSALAMU'ALAYKUM!!!!!

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never
meet before, my name is Mr. Malik Sanfo, but need not to worry as I am
contacting you individually of my exploration and no one is informed
of this communication. I need your urgent assistance in transferring
the sum of $12.3million Dollars immediately to your private account.
The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now
without anybody coming to claim it.

I want you to corporate with me for the release of this money into
your private bank account as the relative to our deceased customer
(the account owner) who died a long time ago and with his supposed
NEXT OF KIN. The Banking law here does not allow such money to stay
more than 10years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank
treasury account as unclaimed fund.

By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how
the business will be executed,

Best Regards,
Mr. Malik Sanfo
