Hi Ville,

Thank you for the patch.

Do display controller usually support changing modifiers for page flips
? I understand from the information about that i915 does, but is that
usual ? Could there be drivers that really on this check to reject
modifier changes, and that aren't prepared to handle them if they are
not rejected by the core ? I'm not opposed to this change, but I'd like
to carefully consider the fallout.
