My Dearest One,

This is Miss. Bruce Richard from Trinidad &Tobago. I am writing from
the hospital in London ,therefore  this mail  is very urgent as  you
can seethat I'm dying in the hospital which I don't  know what
tomorrow will be.I was told by my doctor that I was
poisoned   and has got my liver damaged and can only live for some
months. I  inherited some money ($10.7 Million)from my late father and
I   cannot think of anybody   trying to kill me apart from  my step
mother in order to inherit the money, she is from Ghana
bynationality base in London.

I want you to contact my servant with this formation below:

Servant: James Chukwuma
Address: 28 Whitehall Court, London, SW1A 2EJ, UK.
Email  : servantjameschukwuma28@gmail.com


She will give you the documents of the money and will direct you to a
well known lawyer that I have   appointed to  her, the lawyer   will
assist you to change the documents of the money to your name to
enable the bank transfer the  money to you.

This is the favor I need when you have gotten the money :-

(1) Give 20% of the money to my  Servant James Chukwuma as she has
been there for me through my  illness and I  have promised to
support her in life.

(2) Give 30% of the money to handicap people and charity organization,
then the remaining one is yours.

If I don't hear from you, I will look for another person or an organization.

Please do not forget to contact Servant: James Chukwuma May Almighty
God bless you and use you to  accomplish  my wish.

Pray for me always.
Miss. Bruce Richard.
