commit e54a4424925a27ed94dff046db3ce5caf4b1e748 upstream.

It's possible to change which CRTC is in use for a given
connector/encoder/bridge while we're in self-refresh without fully
disabling the connector/encoder/bridge along the way. This can confuse
the bridge encoder/bridge, because
(a) it needs to track the SR state (trying to perform "active"
    operations while the panel is still in SR can be Bad(TM)); and
(b) it tracks the SR state via the CRTC state (and after the switch, the
    previous SR state is lost).

Thus, we need to either somehow carry the self-refresh state over to the
new CRTC, or else force an encoder/bridge self-refresh transition during
such a switch.

I choose the latter, so we disable the encoder (and exit PSR) before
attaching it to the new CRTC (where we can continue to assume a clean
(non-self-refresh) state).

This fixes PSR issues seen on Rockchip RK3399 systems with
drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/analogix/analogix_dp_core.c.

Change in v2:

- Drop "->enable" condition; this could possibly be "->active" to
  reflect the intended hardware state, but it also is a little
  over-specific. We want to make a transition through "disabled" any
  time we're exiting PSR at the same time as a CRTC switch.
  (Thanks Liu Ying)
