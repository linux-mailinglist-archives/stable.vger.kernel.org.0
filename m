I tracked port_clock down to being the dp link clock (162 or 270) so
that part of the story checks out.

Judging by the rest of the function, I buy that the cdclk and link clock
may be inscrutably tied together, and accept the test result that the
cdclk must be at least the link clock with audio enabled.

It may be that a corner case does require a higher frequency (rather
than just bumping from 266 to 270), but for here and now
