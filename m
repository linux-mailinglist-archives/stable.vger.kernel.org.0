The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm, mremap: fix mremap() expanding vma with addr inside vma
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-mremap-fix-mremap-expanding-vma-with-addr-inside-vma.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-hotfixes-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Subject: mm, mremap: fix mremap() expanding vma with addr inside vma
Date: Fri, 16 Dec 2022 17:32:27 +0100

Since 6.1 we have noticed random rpm install failures that were tracked to
mremap() returning -ENOMEM and to commit ca3d76b0aa80 ("mm: add merging
after mremap resize").

The problem occurs when mremap() expands a VMA in place, but using an
starting address that's not vma->vm_start, but somewhere in the middle. 
The extension_pgoff calculation introduced by the commit is wrong in that
case, so vma_merge() fails due to pgoffs not being compatible.  Fix the
calculation.

By the way it seems that the situations, where rpm now expands a vma from
the middle, were made possible also due to that commit, thanks to the
improved vma merging.  Yet it should work just fine, except for the buggy
calculation.
