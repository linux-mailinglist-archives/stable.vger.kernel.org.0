came across your e-mail contact prior to a private search while in
need of your assistance.

hoping you will cooperate with me as a partner in a project of
transferring an abandoned fund of a late customer of the bank worth of

$18,000,000 (Eighteen Million Dollars US).

This will be disbursed or shared between the both of us in these
percentages, 55% for me and 45% for you. Contact me immediately if

this proposal, please provide the below details for the Mutual
