I do not think you have tested this in any of those kernels, as it
breaks the build :(

Please send a set of patches, properly backported and tested, that you
wish to see applied to stable kernels and we will be glad to review them
and apply them.  But to suggest patches to be merged that you have not
even tested is not good.
