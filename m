Hello,

My name is Mr. Samuel Donkor, a banker and manager of Audit & Accounts
department in my bank. I used to be a personal account manager to
deceased customer of our bank who bears same name as yours, who was
involved in the  Lion Air Flight JT 610 was traveling from Jakarta to
Pangkal Pinang when the Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed into the sea, hearing
the report of his death, I made many inquiries to trace the extended
family or relatives to come forward to claim their inheritance but my
efforts were
aborted. It was my abortive research that I decided to contact you and
appoint you as the next of kin in order for us to claim the deposit he
has with our bank which is at a summary of US$8,500,000. 00.

I am giving you this vital and confidential information in order to
make the deal with you and get the money into your bank as the
recipient and beneficiary because as a foreigner it gives you an
advantage on coming into this matter because the deceased was also a
foreigner. I have made all appropriate arrangements on how the fund
will be transferred to you so i can ask for short leave to come to
your country for us to share the fund. If you are ready to cooperate
with me to get this fund, you will email me back with the necessary
particulars below.

Your full Name,
Age, Sex & Marital Status,
Address with contact telephone and fax numbers.

As soon as I get these information I will call you directly on phone
so we can hear each other voice and plan on the way forward to archive
this aim together.

I see this as a life time opportunity which will benefit both of us at the end.
Therefore, if you can handle this deal, please reach me back through
the below email address for more details.

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.

Regards,
Mr. Samuel Donkor.
