While our code is 'out of tree' (you really don't want it - and since
it still uses force_sig() is fine) I suspect that the 'drdb' code
(with Christoph's allow_signal() patch) now loops in kernel if a user
sends it a signal.

If the driver (eg drdb) is using (say) SIGINT to break a thread out of
(say) a blocking kernel_accept() call then it can detect the unexpected
signal (maybe double-checking with signal_pending()) but I don't think
it can clear down the pending signal so that kernel_accept() blocks
again.

I'm not sure what the 'correct' solution is.
