As an example of just how crazy that script is, here's the output of my
machine for that first CVE issue:

CVE-2017-5715 aka 'Spectre Variant 2, branch target injection'
* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  YES  (Mitigation: Full generic retpoline, IBPB: conditional, IBRS_FW, STIBP: conditional, RSB filling)
* Mitigation 1
  * Kernel is compiled with IBRS support:  YES
    * IBRS enabled and active:  YES  (for firmware code only)
  * Kernel is compiled with IBPB support:  YES
    * IBPB enabled and active:  YES
* Mitigation 2
  * Kernel has branch predictor hardening (arm):  NO
  * Kernel compiled with retpoline option:  YES
    * Kernel compiled with a retpoline-aware compiler:  YES  (kernel reports full retpoline compilation)
  * Kernel supports RSB filling:  UNKNOWN  (couldn't check (couldn't find your kernel image in /boot, if you used netboot, this is normal))
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE  (IBRS+IBPB or retpoline+IBPB+RSB filling, is needed to mitigate

So why is this "Vulnerable"?  Because it didn't think it could find my
kernel image for some odd reason, despite it really being in /boot/ (I
don't use netboot)

So please verify that this really is a real issue, and not just the
script doing foolish things.

thanks,

greg k-h
