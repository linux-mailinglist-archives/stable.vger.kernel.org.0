I agree.

The second approach doesn't unblock things if we end up with
old_status != STOPPED and the queue is really stopped (which shouldn't
happen, unless we have a problem in our state machine). I think I'll
go for the first option and restart the queue unconditionally (I'm
keeping the WARN_ON(), of course).
