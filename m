Hello dear,

My name is Madam Yeshline Jof from Philipine. I am a widow with a
chronic renal insufficiency case, a kidney disease.

However, I want to intimate you of an urgent project I want you to
take up, I will like you to receive a certain deposit I inherited from
my late husband for the use of helping people with renal insufficient
cases.

My late husband deposited the sum of $ 5.7 million with a bank in
Europe before his death while in service as a general in the Army in
my home country, but before his death, he handed me over all the
documents relating to the deposit in the bank and asked me to leave
our country.

Because of my ill health, I am mostly bedridden in the hospital on
renal dialysis, this is a system of artificially doing/performing the
functions of the kidneys. By this, the excess toxic waste products in
my blood are washed out.

I will like you to reply me immediately so that I can detail you
concerning this matter and the next step to take, I want you to take
20% of the money as your own personal money while you use the rest to
put up a safe hospital to treat and help people with kidney cases.

Hope to hearing from you urgently.
Regards.
Madam Yeshline Jof
