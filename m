[ Upstream commit 25795ef6299f07ce3838f3253a9cb34f64efcfae ]

TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT currently isn't part of TASK_REPORT, thus a task blocking
on an rtlock will appear as having a task state == 0, IOW TASK_RUNNING.

The actual state is saved in p->saved_state, but reading it after reading
p->__state has a few issues:
o that could still be TASK_RUNNING in the case of e.g. rt_spin_lock
o ttwu_state_match() might have changed that to TASK_RUNNING

As pointed out by Eric, adding TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT to TASK_REPORT implies
exposing a new state to userspace tools which way not know what to do with
them. The only information that needs to be conveyed here is that a task is
waiting on an rt_mutex, which matches TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE - there's no
need for a new state.
