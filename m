[ Upstream commit dbae3388ea9ca33bd1d5eabc3b0ef17e69c74677 ]

On mv88e6xxx 1G/2.5G PCS, the SerDes register 4.2001.2 has the following
description:
  This register bit indicates when link was lost since the last
  read. For the current link status, read this register
  back-to-back.

Thus to get current link state, we need to read the register twice.

But doing that in the link change interrupt handler would lead to
potentially ignoring link down events, which we really want to avoid.

Thus this needs to be solved in phylink's resolve, by retriggering
another resolve in the event when PCS reports link down and previous
link was up, and by re-reading PCS state if the previous link was down.

The wrong value is read when phylink requests change from sgmii to
2500base-x mode, and link won't come up. This fixes the bug.
