[ Upstream commit e2ee9edc282961783d519c760bbaa20fed4dec38 ]

The original qcom kernel changed the PDM GPIOs to be pull-down
during sleep at some point. Reportedly this was done because
there was some "leakage at PDM outputs during sleep":

  https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/kernel/msm-3.10/commit/?id=0f87e08c1cd3e6484a6f7fb3e74e37340bdcdee0

I cannot say how effective this is, but everything seems to work
fine with this change so let's apply the same to mainline just
to be sure.
