My Dear,
It's my pleasure to have contact with you, based on the critical
condition I find mine self, though, it's not financial problem, but my
health, you might have know that cancer is not what to talk home
about,I am married to Mr. Shine Zuthimalin  who worked with Tunisia
embassy in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year
2008.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a
brief illness that lasted for five days.Since his death I decided not
to remarry, When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$
9 .2m (nine million two hundred thousand dollars) in a bank in Burkina
Faso, Presently this money is still in bank. And My Doctor told me
that I don't have much time to live because of the cancer problem,
Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this fond to take
care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take 30 Percent of
the total money for your personal use While 70% of the money will go
to charity" people and helping the orphanage. I don't want my
husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I grew up as an Orphan
and I don't have anybody as my family member,
Mrs. Shahinaz Zuthimalin
