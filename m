Hello Friend,
Greetings to you. I know it will be difficult for you to believe my
story but it is nothing but the real truth. I=E2=80=99m Mrs.Grace Remond an=
d I
have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says
that I have just few days to leave. I am from (Paris) France, but
based in Africa Burkina Faso since eight years ago as a business woman
dealing with gold exportation and cotton Sales.

Now, that I am about to end the race like this, without any family
members and no child. I have $6.8mollion (b.o.a) Burkina Faso which I
instructed the Bank to give St Andrews Missionary and Home Kizito
Orphanage in Burkina Faso. But my mind is not at rest because I am
writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside my sick
bed.
I have instructed the bank to transfer the fund to you as a foreigner
that will apply to the bank after I have gone that they should release
the fund to him/her, but you will assure me that you will take 50
percent of the fund and 50 percent to the orphanage as I instructed
for my heart to rest in peace. Respond to me immediately for further
details since I have just few days to end my life due to the ovarian
cancer disease, hoping you will understand my situation and give
favorable attention. Replay me here: ( mrs.graceremond12@gmail.com )
Thank you and God bless you,

Mrs.Grace Remond
