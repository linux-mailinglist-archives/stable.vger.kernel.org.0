Without this fix the built-in USB function source/sink test module fails to work with isochronous endpoints [1]. A side-effect of setting dep->flags = DWC3_EP_ENABLED; in dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_completed_requests() as part of disabling an ep is that a subsequent attempt to enable the endpoint will skip __dwc3_gadget_ep_enable() effectively leaving the ep disabled.
