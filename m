3.16.75-rc1 review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Andrea Arcangeli <aarcange@redhat.com>

commit 59ea6d06cfa9247b586a695c21f94afa7183af74 upstream.

When fixing the race conditions between the coredump and the mmap_sem
holders outside the context of the process, we focused on
mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm() callers in 04f5866e41fb70 ("coredump: fix
race condition between mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm() and core
dumping"), but those aren't the only cases where the mmap_sem can be
taken outside of the context of the process as Michal Hocko noticed
while backporting that commit to older -stable kernels.

If mmgrab() is called in the context of the process, but then the
mm_count reference is transferred outside the context of the process,
that can also be a problem if the mmap_sem has to be taken for writing
through that mm_count reference.

khugepaged registration calls mmgrab() in the context of the process,
but the mmap_sem for writing is taken later in the context of the
khugepaged kernel thread.

collapse_huge_page() after taking the mmap_sem for writing doesn't
modify any vma, so it's not obvious that it could cause a problem to the
coredump, but it happens to modify the pmd in a way that breaks an
invariant that pmd_trans_huge_lock() relies upon.  collapse_huge_page()
needs the mmap_sem for writing just to block concurrent page faults that
call pmd_trans_huge_lock().

Specifically the invariant that "!pmd_trans_huge()" cannot become a
"pmd_trans_huge()" doesn't hold while collapse_huge_page() runs.

The coredump will call __get_user_pages() without mmap_sem for reading,
which eventually can invoke a lockless page fault which will need a
functional pmd_trans_huge_lock().

So collapse_huge_page() needs to use mmget_still_valid() to check it's
not running concurrently with the coredump...  as long as the coredump
can invoke page faults without holding the mmap_sem for reading.

This has "Fixes: khugepaged" to facilitate backporting, but in my view
it's more a bug in the coredump code that will eventually have to be
rewritten to stop invoking page faults without the mmap_sem for reading.
So the long term plan is still to drop all mmget_still_valid().
