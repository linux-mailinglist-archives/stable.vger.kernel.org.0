Subject: [PATCH v2] locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath
Date:   Thu, 15 Apr 2021 17:27:11 +0000

While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can
acquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops
checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly
acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed
successfully which isnâ€™t ordered. This exposes the window between the
acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads following
the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before the write
lock is truly acquired.

We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while
holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from under it.

Writer                               | Reader 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ep_scan_ready_list()                 |
|- write_lock_irq()                  |
    |- queued_write_lock_slowpath()  |
      |- atomic_cond_read_acquire()  |
                                     | read_lock_irqsave(&ep->lock, flags);
   --> (observes value before unlock)|  chain_epi_lockless()
   |                                 |    epi->next = xchg(&ep->ovflist, epi);
   |                                 | read_unlock_irqrestore(&ep->lock, flags);
   |                                 |
   |     atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed()    |
   |-- READ_ONCE(ep->ovflist);       |

A core can order the read of the ovflist ahead of the
atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed(). Switching the cmpxchg to use acquire semantics
addresses this issue at which point the atomic_cond_read can be switched
to use relaxed semantics.
