[ Upstream commit f54dada8274643e3ff4436df0ea124aeedc43cae ]

In valid_user_regs() we treat SSBS as a RES0 bit, and consequently it is
unexpectedly cleared when we restore a sigframe or fiddle with GPRs via
ptrace.

This patch fixes valid_user_regs() to account for this, updating the
function to refer to the latest ARM ARM (ARM DDI 0487D.a). For AArch32
tasks, SSBS appears in bit 23 of SPSR_EL1, matching its position in the
AArch32-native PSR format, and we don't need to translate it as we have
to for DIT.

There are no other bit assignments that we need to account for today.
As the recent documentation describes the DIT bit, we can drop our
comment regarding DIT.

While removing SSBS from the RES0 masks, existing inconsistent
whitespace is corrected.
