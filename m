My Dear friend,

I am contacting you independently of my investigation in my bank and
no one is informed of this communication. I need your urgent
assistance in transferring the sum of $13.5million dollars to Your
private account, that belongs to one of our late foreign customer who
died a longtime with his supposed NEXT OF KIN since the year 2005. The
money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without
anybody coming for the claim of it as the deceased relation.

I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased
customer, the Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay more
than 15years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank Treasury
account as unclaimed fund. I am ready to share with you 40% for you
and 60% for me, by indicating your interest I will send you the full
details on how the business will be executed without any hitch.

I will be waiting for your urgent response.

Thanks.

Best Regards,


Mr. Mohammad Ahmed
