From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

commit 45bf39f8df7f05efb83b302c65ae3b9bc92b7065 upstream.

Ever since commit 83e83ecb79a8 ("usb: core: get config and string
descriptors for unauthorized devices") was merged in 2013, there has
been no mechanism for reallocating the rawdescriptors buffers in
struct usb_device after the initial enumeration.  Before that commit,
the buffers would be deallocated when a device was deauthorized and
reallocated when it was authorized and enumerated.

This means that the locking in the read_descriptors() routine is not
needed, since the buffers it reads will never be reallocated while the
routine is running.  This locking can interfere with user programs
trying to read a hub's descriptors via sysfs while new child devices
of the hub are being initialized, since the hub is locked during this
procedure.

Since the locking in read_descriptors() hasn't been needed for over
nine years, we can remove it.
