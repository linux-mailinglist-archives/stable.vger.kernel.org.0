Checking against VMA is safe too, the difference is current code still
allows thp to be collapsed as long as none of the page is explicitly
protected over the thp range, even if the range is registered with
userfault-wp.  That's also what e1e267c7928f does.

Here we have slightly different handling between anon / file thps (file
thps checks against the vma flags), IMHO mostly because we don't scan
pgtables when making decisions to collapse a shmem thp, so we made it
simple by checking against vma flags.  We can make it the same as anon but
it might be an overkill just to scan the entries for uffd-wp purpose.

For anon we always scans the pgtable anyway so it's easier to make a more
accurate decision.
