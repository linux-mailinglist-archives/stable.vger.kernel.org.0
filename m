[ Upstream commit 3a8ecc935efabdad106b5e06d07b150c394b4465 ]

Commit 7fd8930f26be4

  "nvme: add a common helper to read Identify Controller data"

has re-introduced an issue that we have attempted to work around in the
past, in commit a310acd7a7ea ("NVMe: use split lo_hi_{read,write}q").

The problem is that some PCIe NVMe controllers do not implement 64-bit
outbound accesses correctly, which is why the commit above switched
to using lo_hi_[read|write]q for all 64-bit BAR accesses occuring in
the code.

In the mean time, the NVMe subsystem has been refactored, and now calls
into the PCIe support layer for NVMe via a .reg_read64() method, which
fails to use lo_hi_readq(), and thus reintroduces the problem that the
workaround above aimed to address.

Given that, at the moment, .reg_read64() is only used to read the
capability register [which is known to tolerate split reads], let's
switch .reg_read64() to lo_hi_readq() as well.

This fixes a boot issue on some ARM boxes with NVMe behind a Synopsys
DesignWare PCIe host controller.
