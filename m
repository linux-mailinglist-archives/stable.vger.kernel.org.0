PC adjustment is easy-ish: have a vcpu to hit WFI with no interrupt
pending, send the thread a signal to make it exit to userspace, update
the PC to another address, and check that the instruction at that
address is actually executed.

Exception injection is a lot more difficult: you need to force a vcpu
exit to userspace right after having caused an exception to be
injected by KVM. I can't think of an easy way to do that other than
repeatedly executing an instruction that generates an exception while
signalling the thread to force the exit. Ugly.
