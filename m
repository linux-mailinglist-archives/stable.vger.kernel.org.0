or simply nid = cpu_to_mem(cpu)

Yes, that is what I had in mind. We are talking about two things here.
Memoryless nodes and offline nodes. The later sounds like a bug to me.

Right

Historically, those allocation interfaces were not trying to be robust
against wrong inputs because that adds cpu cycles for everybody for
"what if buggy" code. This has worked (surprisingly) well. Memory less
nodes have brought in some confusion but this is still something that we
can address on a higher level. Nobody give arbitrary nodes as an input.
cpu_to_node might be tricky because it can point to a memory less node
which along with __GFP_THISNODE is very likely not something anybody
wants. Hence cpu_to_mem should be used for allocations. I hate we have
two very similar APIs...

But something seems wrong in this case. cpu_to_node shouldn't return
offline nodes. That is just a land mine. It is not clear to me how the
cpu has been brought up so that the numa node allocation was left
behind. As pointed in other email add_cpu resp. cpu_up is not it.
Is it possible that the cpu bring up was only half way?
