commit 331cd9461412e103d07595a10289de90004ac890 upstream.

When enabling quotas, at btrfs_quota_enable(), after committing the
transaction, we change fs_info->quota_root to point to the quota root we
created and set BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED at fs_info->flags. Then we try
to start the qgroup rescan worker, first by initializing it with a call
to qgroup_rescan_init() - however if that fails we end up freeing the
quota root but we leave fs_info->quota_root still pointing to it, this
can later result in a use-after-free somewhere else.

We have previously set the flags BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED and
BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON, so we can only fail with -EINPROGRESS at
btrfs_quota_enable(), which is possible if someone already called the
quota rescan ioctl, and therefore started the rescan worker.

So fix this by ignoring an -EINPROGRESS and asserting we can't get any
other error.
