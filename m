Dear Mark,

So I frankly don't have the experience to disagree with you :-) Your
reasoning certainly seems sound to me. My original motivation for the
patch (after discussion with others within the mentorship process) was
that some other sound SoC drivers do this, an example being the Ux500. I
defer to the decision of the community as a whole of course, and am
happy with whatever is decided.

Regards,
Phil
