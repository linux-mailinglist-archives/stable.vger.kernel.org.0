It may indeed be a livelock instead of a deadlock. I have received a 
newer trace and it indeed shows kswapd in running state. But no progress 
in 120s and dead machine sounded like too suspicious it could happen 
with just a gaming workload so I assumed a more serious issue than just 
severe memory pressure.

Presumably this would involve an extra worker and tracking on a list or 
something?

Otherwise my main hope really was to get a verdict from memory 
management experts on pros & cons of doing writeback from the driver in 
any flavour.

No, but maybe Renato you could also collect "echo d" and "echo m" to 
sysrq-trigger when things go bad?
