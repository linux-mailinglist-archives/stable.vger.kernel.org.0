Hello friend,

I am Sir. Thomas J. Collins, Sorry for contacting you this late, but
am happy to inform you about my success in getting those fund
transferred to Japan through the help of a new partner who assisted me
and make sure the fund was transferred with the help of his company,
As we speak right now i have moved to Japan to meet him for sharing
according to the percentage as agreed, right now i am having a good
time here with him as we are planing to use the fund to set up a new
company here in Tokyo where both of us will manage it together.

Though i did not forget all your past effort to support me get the
fund which failed us somehow, So for this reason i have decided to
compensate you with the sum of USD$800,000.00 (Eight Hundred Thousand
United State Dollars Only) for your past effort, and i like to inform
you that i have left an instruction to my lawyer Hon. Barr. Henry to
send your bank cheque to you without delay so that once you receive
the amount we can now share the joy together as part of the good
relationship we shared at that time.

Like i said i have instructed my lawyer Hon. Barr. Henry to quickly
send your bank cashier cheque to you once you contact him which i left
for your compensation, So quickly contact my lawyer vie his email
contacts as indicated herein below.

Name: Hon. Barr. Henry
Email: henrylawchambers01@gmail.com

Contact him immediately as he will be waiting for you to contact him
as instructed and do well to inform me once you receive your cheque
from my lawyer and cash your money so we can share the joy together,
Once again am sorry that i did not contact you again since then as i
have been busy searching for a solution to get the fund transferred
through the help of the new partner, So am in Tokyo Japan right now
for business investment, I wish you good luck and hoping to hear good
news from you as soon as you receive your cheque from my lawyer Hon.
Barr. Henry and cash your money so we can be happy together, Good
luck.
