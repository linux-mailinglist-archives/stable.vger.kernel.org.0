commit addf3382c47c033e579c9c88f18e36c4e75d806a upstream.

This partially reverts commit 27fc32fd9417968a459d43d9a7c50fd423d53eb9.

It turns out that the G502 has some issues with hid-logitech-hidpp:
when plugging it in, the driver tries to contact it but it fails.
So the driver bails out leaving only the mouse event node available.

This timeout is problematic as it introduce a delay in the boot,
and having only the mouse event node means that the hardware
macros keys can not be relayed to the userspace.

Filipe and I just gave a shot at the following devices:

G403 Wireless (0xC082)
G703 (0xC087)
G703 Hero (0xC090)
G903 (0xC086)
G903 Hero (0xC091)
G Pro (0xC088)

Reverting the devices we are not sure that works flawlessly.

For the v5.2 stable kernels. v5.2.11 picked up upstream commit
27fc32fd9417 ("HID: logitech-hidpp: add USB PID for a few more supported
mice") and v5.2.12 picked up commit a3384b8d9f63cc0 ("HID:
logitech-hidpp: remove support for the G700 over USB") with some
conflicts because this patch wasn't picked up. This backport resolves
the conflicts against v5.2.17.
