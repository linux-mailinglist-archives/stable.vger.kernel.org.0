I remain rather set on wanting some very basic tests with this change.
Imho, looking through tools/testing/selftests again we don't have nearly
enough for these codepaths; not to say none. Basically, if someone wants
to make a change affecting the current problem we should really have at
least a single simple test/reproducer that can be run without digging
through lore. And hopefully over time we'll have more tests.
