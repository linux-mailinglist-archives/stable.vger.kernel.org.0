MODERN ACADEMIC EDITING
www.modernacademicedit.com


Don't allow poor spelling or poor formatting in a target journal deny your manuscript(s) of publication in high-quality journals
Don't become one of the hundreds of authors who have their manuscripts rejected due to spelling errors, grammatical errors, typographical errors or punctuation errors.
Hence, what Are You Waiting For?
Modern Academic Editing is the most trusted academic proofreading and editing services for you.

Dear Colleague,
MODERN ACADEMIC EDITING is the Number 1 choice for native and non-native English speaking professionals, authors, and individuals from around the globe in ensuring the highest-possible quality of editing and making sure that their ideas are communicated clearly and effectively. Thousands of academic authors and researchers have already experienced our specialist Proofreading services — now it’s your turn! Therefore, we call on writers/authors in all fields of academics to submit their manuscripts for proofreading/editing. We also observed that incorrect grammar, punctuation, spelling or syntax often leads to a negative response to your manuscript from reviewers, and using an online grammar correction service will not always highlight mistakes. Hence, we advise that authors should send their manuscript(s) to us for accurate grammatical proofreading and editing.

We invite you to submit your articles and theses (MS-Word document) as e-mail attachment to the Editorial Office at: articles@modernacademicedit.com or modernacademicedit@gmail.com. Articles are expected to be in double line spacing (Still depends on the journal's format). Upon receipt of the Manuscript, an acknowledgment letter, including the manuscript number and the payment charges, will be sent to the corresponding author.

Our charges are as follows:
