my Dear friend,

My Name is Mrs.Evana Prso, from Norway. I know that this message will
be a surprise to you. Firstly, I am married to Mr.Patrick Prso.A gold
merchant who owns a small gold Mine in Syria; He died of
Cardiovascular Disease in mid-March 2011. During his life time he
deposited the sum of (=E2=82=AC16.1 Million Euro) sixteen million, one hund=
red
thousand Euros in a bank in Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina
Faso in West Africa. The deposited money was from the sale of the
shares, death benefits payment and entitlements of my deceased husband
by his company. I am sending this message to you praying that it will
reach you in good health, since I am not in good health condition in
which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the
next day.

 I am suffering from long time cancer and presently i am partially
suffering from a stroke illness which has become almost impossible for
me to move around. I am married to my late husband for over 4 years
before he died and is unfortunately that we don't have a child, my
doctor confinded in me that i have less chance to live. Having known
my health condition, I decided to contact you to claim the fund since
I don't have any relation I grew up from the orphanage home, I have
decided to donate what I have to you for the support of helping
Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and
diagnosed of cancer for about 2 years ago. I have been touched by God
almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to
you for good work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to
forgive me and believe he has, because He is a Merciful God I will be
going in for an operation surgery soon.

 This is the reason i need your services to stand as my next of kin or
an executor to claim the funds for charity purposes. If this money
remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the
government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for
selfish and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can
claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows
and also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my
late husband and my name; I need your urgent answer to know if you
will be able to execute this project, and I will give you more
information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account.


Thanks,
Mrs.Evana Prso.
