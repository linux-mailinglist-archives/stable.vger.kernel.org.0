Great, thanks for working to figure this out.

It's a judgement call on my side as to when to do the release, based on
the testing that has happened, any reports, and my knowledge of what is
in the patches themselves.  For this patchset, all of the expected
testers came back with no problems, except for your report.

And if your report turned out to be real (the fact that it was a
backport of an "old" patch made it much less likely to be real), I can
always instantly revert it and push out a new release quickly for the
tiny subset of those that have problems with this.

So I took a guess based on all of this and decided it was more important
to get the release out early, so that it can start to make its way to
the huge majority of systems that did report testing worked fine, than
to delay it to wait for your single system report.  Because again, if
this turned out to be a real issue, a quick release for any affected
systems would have been trivial to create.

thanks,
