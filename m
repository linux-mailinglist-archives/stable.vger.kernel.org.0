My Dearest,

I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.
With due respect, trust and humanity, i appeal to you to exercise a
little patience and read through my letter i feel quite safe dealing
with you in this important business having gone through your
remarkable profile, honestly i am writing this email to you with
pains, tears and sorrow from my heart, i will really like to have a
good relationship with you and i have a special reason why I decided
to contact you. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of my
situation.

My name is Miss.Harrita Kipkalya, 23yrs old female and i am from Kenya
in East Africa. Light in complexion, single (never married) but
presently i am residing here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso refugee
camp. My father Late Dr Kipkalya Kones was the former Kenyan road
Minister. He and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had
been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho and crashed
in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya. The plane crashed
on the Tuesday 10th, June, 2008. You can read more about the crash
through the below site:
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html?iref=
=3Dnextin

After the burial of my father, my Fathers brother conspired and sold
my father' s property to an Italian Expert rate which they shared the
money among themselves and live nothing for me. One faithful morning,
I opened my father's briefcase and found out the documents which he
have deposited huge amount of money in one bank in Burkina Faso with
my name as the next of kin because when he was alive he deposited some
amount of money in a Bank in Burkina Faso which he used my name as the
next of kin. The amount in question is $4.7Million.

I have informed the bank about claiming this money and the only thing
they told me is to look for a foreign partner who will assist me in
the transfer due to my refugee status here in Burkina Faso. God told
me that you are the honest and reliable person who will help me and
stand as my trustee so that I will present you to the Bank for
transferring of my father=E2=80=99s money to your bank account in overseas.=
I
have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you
will not betray my trust. But rather take me as your own biological
sister or daughter which I will be coming to your country as soon as
this money is transferred to your account.

My dearest, things are very bad for me here in the refugee camp where
i am living today. People are dying here day after day because of lack
of food and poor medical treatment. Even one of us died last night and
was buried this morning. I am afraid of what i am seeing here. I don't
know who it will be her turn tomorrow, I was planning to read law in
my life before the ugly incident that killed my parents that put me in
this horrible place i found myself toady. This place is like a prison
as we are only allowed to go out on Monday and Friday of the week as
given by the united nation rules and regulation here in Burkina Faso.
It=E2=80=99s in this refugee we are only allowed to go out two times in a w=
eek
it=E2=80=99s just like one staying in the prison and i hope by Gods grace i
will come out here soon. I don' t have any relatives now whom i can go
to and the only person i have now is Rev Isaac Ambrose who is the
pastor of the (Christ for all Churches) here in the refugee he has
been very nice to me since i came here but i am not living with him
rather i am leaving in the women's hostel because the refugee have two
hostels one for men the other for women, so you can always contact me
through this my both email address here
(kipkalyamissharrita@gmail.com) thanks and am waiting for your reply.
Please if you want to help me out of this situation respond back so
that i will tell you more about me.

Yours faithful
Miss.Harrita Kipkalya
