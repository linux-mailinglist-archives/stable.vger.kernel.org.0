Perhaps we can simply make this "if" to be "else" so as to connect with the
previous "if"?  After all the three (wp, wp_resolv, dirty_acct) are never
used with more than one flag set.

I'll see whether I should prepare a patch and a test, maybe after yours.

I see.  I didn't expect mprotect() can work well with uffd, but it seems
fine at least in this case.

Have you thought about other use of mprotect() other than RO?  Say, I only
know a valid use case of PROT_NONE for region reservation purpose, which
normally will be followed up by a munmap() and remap on the same address.
That sounds okay.  But not sure whether this patch will cover all the
possible mprotect() uses in the tracee.

Sure, I'm always happy to learn it.  Thanks,
