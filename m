You're right. What we're seeing is an A-B-A problem that can allow 
atomic_cond_read_acquire() to succeed and before the cmpxchg succeeds a reader
performs an A-B-A on the lock which allows the core to observe a read that
follows the cmpxchg ahead of the cmpxchg succeeding. 

We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while
holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from under it. 

Writer                               | Reader 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ep_scan_ready_list()                 |
|- write_lock_irq()                  |
    |- queued_write_lock_slowpath()  |
      |- atomic_cond_read_acquire()  |
                                     | read_lock_irqsave(&ep->lock, flags);
                                     | chain_epi_lockless()
                                     |    epi->next = xchg(&ep->ovflist, epi);
                                     | read_unlock_irqrestore(&ep->lock, flags);
                                     |       
         atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed()    |
  READ_ONCE(ep->ovflist);

It seems plausible that the same thing could occur here in qspinlock:
          if ((val & _Q_TAIL_MASK) == tail) {
                  if (atomic_try_cmpxchg_relaxed(&lock->val, &val, _Q_LOCKED_VAL))
                          goto release; /* No contention */
          }

Ack, will fix.
