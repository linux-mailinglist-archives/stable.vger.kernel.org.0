Dear to you!!
I am Mrs. Mercier Veronique and a widow Patient who suffers a Cancer.I
am well known as a director of Gold and Cotton products exportation
Merchant in my country. Unfortunately,I experience restlessness and
sleepless nights, so my Doctor sent me on a general Medical Checkup
which I was finally diagnosed to have breast cancer of the Lungs.

I have been living and struggling with breast cancer for close to 18
months now though a widow, Since the break of my horrible dilemma, I
have gone through series of operations and still to undergo a final
operation within the next few days, I am afraid because this will be
my first major operation, is likely I will not survival after the
operation.

Base, on my last discussion with my Lawyer, the future of my life is
giving me pains; I am seeking your assistance in taking control of
managing my fund as a Foreigner. In regards to a Charity Project for
helping Less privileged people as well as orphanages, widows and for
propagating the word of God which I want to entrust into your care,
the fund Worth $6.800.000.00 M USD was fixed deposit in a Bank.

Please get back to me if you can handle the project for more details
and explanations.
Yours,
Mrs.Mercier Veroniqu.
