Each time we encounter a contended object lock we do the backoff here, 
drop the vm->mutex and retry the lock with the full lock. When 
re-entering evict_vm() that is one less object we need to lock again (we 
don't drop it until we destroy the ww ctx). The number of objects in a 
VM is finite (hopefully not too many for normal workloads).

Note that in in evict_vm() there is: 
dma_resv_locking_ctx(vma->obj->base.resv) == &ww->ctx, which returns 
true if we have already locked this object, with the given ww ctx (so 
eb->ww here).

We now do i915_gem_object_get_rcu() above (still returns false if 
dying), since busy_bo will need a reference to the BO to keep it alive, 
when returning from evict_vm(). If busy_bo is NULL we just drop that 
reference here to keep it all balanced.

Ignoring this patch, the ret = 0 here looks to not be needed. The only 
time ret is non zero is below when unbinding stuff, and here the "while 
(ret == 0)" at the end will catch that and bail anyway. So this 
shouldn't have any change in behaviour AFAICT.

With this patch I just want to set ret = -EBUSY and eventually return 
that to the caller, and setting ret = 0 here gets in the way.

The unbind() here just nukes the GPU page-tables for this VMA (once we 
are sure the GPU is not still accessing them) and deletes the drm_mm 
node from the VM, so the next user can use that GPU address/range. I 
guess we could still do the unbind with -EBUSY, but not doing it 
shouldn't break anything.

Above we do i915_gem_object_get_rcu(), so this is just balancing that. 
We get here either because the object is dying, in which case we don't 
have or need a reference (or lock it seems). If it's not dying then we 
already locked it, either because of the new retry thing added in this 
patch, or if the object was locked as part of the execbuf. We also hold 
a ref in that case.
