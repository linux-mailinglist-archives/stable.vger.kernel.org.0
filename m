In arch_tlbbatch_add_mm()? inc_mm_tlb_gen() has builtin barrier as its
comment says -- atomic update ops that return values are also full
memory barriers.

This isn't a problem either because flush_required is per thread.

One thing worth noting is not all arm/arm64 hw versions support ranges.
(system_supports_tlb_range()). But IIUC what you are trying to do, this
isn't a problem.

No worries. I brought it up only because I noticed it and didn't want
it to slip away.
