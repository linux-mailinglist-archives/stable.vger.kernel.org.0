This is a generic problem, cfr. scripts/link-vmlinux.sh:

        # kallsyms support
        # Generate section listing all symbols and add it into vmlinux
        # It's a three step process:
        # 1)  Link .tmp_vmlinux1 so it has all symbols and sections,
        #     but __kallsyms is empty.
        #     Running kallsyms on that gives us .tmp_kallsyms1.o with
        #     the right size
        # 2)  Link .tmp_vmlinux2 so it now has a __kallsyms section of
        #     the right size, but due to the added section, some
        #     addresses have shifted.
        #     From here, we generate a correct .tmp_kallsyms2.o
        # 3)  That link may have expanded the kernel image enough that
        #     more linker branch stubs / trampolines had to be added, which
        #     introduces new names, which further expands kallsyms. Do another
        #     pass if that is the case. In theory it's possible this results
        #     in even more stubs, but unlikely.
        #     KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=1 may also used to debug or work around
        #     other bugs.

Adding even more kallsyms_steps may help (or not, if you're really
unlucky).  Perhaps the number of passes should be handled automatically
(i.e. run until it succeeds, with a sane (16?) upper limit to avoid
 endless builds, so it can still fail, in theory).
