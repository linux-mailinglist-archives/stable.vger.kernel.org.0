Fix an issue with the Tyan Tomcat IV S1564D system, the BIOS of which 
does not assign PCI buses beyond #2, where our resource reallocation 
code preserves the reset default of an I/O BAR assignment outside its 
upstream PCI-to-PCI bridge's I/O forwarding range for device 06:08.0 in 
this log:

Since both 06:08.0 and 06:08.1 have the same reset defaults the latter 
device escapes its fate and gets a good assignment owing to an address 
conflict with the former device.

Consequently when the device driver tries to access 06:08.0 according to 
its designated address range it pokes at an unassigned I/O location, 
likely subtractively decoded by the southbridge and forwarded to ISA, 
causing the driver to become confused and bail out:

uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host system error, PCI problems?
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host controller process error, something bad happened!
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host controller halted, very bad!
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: HCRESET not completed yet!
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: HC died; cleaning up

if good luck happens or if bad luck does, an infinite flood of messages:

uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host system error, PCI problems?
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host controller process error, something bad happened!
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host system error, PCI problems?
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host controller process error, something bad happened!
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host system error, PCI problems?
uhci_hcd 0000:06:08.0: host controller process error, something bad happened!
[...]

making the system virtually unusuable.

This is because we have code to deal with a situation from PR #16263, 
where broken ACPI firmware reports the wrong address range for the host 
bridge's decoding window and trying to adjust to the window causes more 
breakage than leaving the BIOS assignments intact.

This may work for a device directly on the root bus decoded by the host 
bridge only, but for a device behind one or more PCI-to-PCI (or CardBus) 
bridges those bridges' forwarding windows have been standardised and 
need to be respected, or leaving whatever has been there in a downstream 
device's BAR will have no effect as cycles for the addresses recorded 
there will have no chance to appear on the bus the device has been 
immediately attached to.

Make sure then for a device behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge that any firmware 
assignment is within the bridge's relevant forwarding window or do not 
restore the assignment, fixing the system concerned as follows:

pci_bus 0000:00: max bus depth: 4 pci_try_num: 5

and making device 06:08.0 work correctly.

Changes from v1:

- Do restore firmware BAR assignments behind a PCI-PCI bridge, but only if 
  within the bridge's forwarding window.

- Update the change description and heading accordingly (was: PCI: Do not 
  restore firmware BAR assignments behind a PCI-PCI bridge).
