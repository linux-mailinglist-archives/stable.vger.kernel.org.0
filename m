commit a880b28a71e39013e357fd3adccd1d8a31bc69a8 upstream.

wake_up_poll() uses nr_exclusive=1, so it's not guaranteed to wake up
all exclusive waiters.  Yet, POLLFREE *must* wake up all waiters.  epoll
and aio poll are fortunately not affected by this, but it's very
fragile.  Thus, the new function wake_up_pollfree() has been introduced.

Convert binder to use wake_up_pollfree().

Reported-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Fixes: f5cb779ba163 ("ANDROID: binder: remove waitqueue when thread exits.")
