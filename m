3.16.80-rc1 review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

commit 54f83b8c8ea9b22082a496deadf90447a326954e upstream.

Endpoints with a maxpacket length of 0 are probably useless.  They
can't transfer any data, and it's not at all unlikely that a UDC will
crash or hang when trying to handle a non-zero-length usb_request for
such an endpoint.  Indeed, dummy-hcd gets a divide error when trying
to calculate the remainder of a transfer length by the maxpacket
value, as discovered by the syzbot fuzzer.

Currently the gadget core does not check for endpoints having a
maxpacket value of 0.  This patch adds a check to usb_ep_enable(),
preventing such endpoints from being used.

As far as I know, none of the gadget drivers in the kernel tries to
create an endpoint with maxpacket = 0, but until now there has been
nothing to prevent userspace programs under gadgetfs or configfs from
doing it.
