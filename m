commit 6a2d90ba027adba528509ffa27097cffd3879257 upstream.

The current implementation of PTRACE_KILL is buggy and has been for
many years as it assumes it's target has stopped in ptrace_stop.  At a
quick skim it looks like this assumption has existed since ptrace
support was added in linux v1.0.

While PTRACE_KILL has been deprecated we can not remove it as
a quick search with google code search reveals many existing
programs calling it.

When the ptracee is not stopped at ptrace_stop some fields would be
set that are ignored except in ptrace_stop.  Making the userspace
visible behavior of PTRACE_KILL a noop in those case.

As the usual rules are not obeyed it is not clear what the
consequences are of calling PTRACE_KILL on a running process.
Presumably userspace does not do this as it achieves nothing.

Replace the implementation of PTRACE_KILL with a simple
send_sig_info(SIGKILL) followed by a return 0.  This changes the
observable user space behavior only in that PTRACE_KILL on a process
not stopped in ptrace_stop will also kill it.  As that has always
been the intent of the code this seems like a reasonable change.
